1397612,B001DKMZ3G,5,These are great for someone who just uses colored pencils occasionally or casually. The variety of colors is good.  A great value! Excellent for the price
1397613,B001DKMZ3G,5,I love these. They blend really well and they don't break when you sharpen them like the Crayola ones do. I highly recommend these instead of Crayola. Great!
1397614,B001DKMZ3G,5,"We gave these to our daughters for Christmas to use with the Dover coloring books.  Great combination and the girls have been happily coloring for days now.  Better quality than Crayola, not as good as the super-duper art pencils.  Definitely good enough for us! Nice colored pencils"
1397615,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These are a great buy for the price.  Quality is adequate for children and adults.  Professional artists may want to look elsewhere, but for the rest of us....these are just fine. sargent art pencils"
1397616,B001DKMZ3G,5,Love these pencils!  Lots of vibrant colors.  They don't break.  The blend well together.  Sharpen nicely.  Best of all they are named!  I really hate it when these colored pencils aren't named or even numbered. Love these pencils

1397653,B001DKMZ3G,5,"My 6 year old asked for colored pencils for his birthday. He was very happy with these. For some reason, he's fascinated by metallic colors, so he particularly liked the gold, copper, and silver colored pencils.

I'm not an artist, so I can't address how useful these would be to the serious student or creator of art. But it's a great collection of pencils for the child --or adult-- who wants to move past the basic colors. Big hit w/ my 6 year old"

1397709,B001DKMZ3G,5,smooth to use and good color output. nice color pencils.
1397710,B001DKMZ3G,1,Item came open and with 15 color pencils missing. One Star
1397711,B001DKMZ3G,5,great it has all the colors I wanted Five Stars
1397712,B001DKMZ3G,4,Great value and good quality. A staple for kids
1397713,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I am a ""beginner"" with colored pencils, and do not have a lot of experience blending colors.  I bought these for use in adult coloring books.  I don't have the budget to spend on high priced alternatives to learn with.  I don't expect to use colored pencils a lot in the future, so these seem like a decent compromise between price and quality.

My first reaction is that this set could use a couple more purples and fewer greens.  It seems very heavy on warm colors.  The reds lean more orange as well, with only one true ""red"".  The ""gold"" and ""silver"" are not metallic- the gold is a brown/gray and the silver looks very similar to regular graphite pencil. There are a total of 48 colors, with 2 white and 2 black pencils.

Included are some photos of my swatch page for this brand.  Please be aware that monitor colors differ and the colors may not appear as vibrant as reality.  Swatched on plain ""printer"" paper, not cardstock or toothy quality paper.  Each box is colored with the same pressure.  The top third of each box is one layer of color.  The middle third is two layers of color.  The bottom third is three layers.  The left side is not blended while the right side is blended with a Prisma colorless pencil.  Also included is a quick coloring page done with minimal blending using only these pencils.

I would say these should work fine for my needs, HOWEVER, true ""artists"" who are looking for blend-able highly pigmented pencils probably wouldn't like them.  I think they are best suited for students or learners who are not willing to shell out for the high-priced  brands.  This is definitely a case of ""you get what you pay for"".  I would like to point out that these are a bit more ""buttery""and lay down smoother than the Crayola brand at the same price.  It I had to choose between them, I would opt for the Sargent brand over the Crayola. A good value for students"
1397714,B001DKMZ3G,4,Great for doodling. The finest colored pencil.
1397715,B001DKMZ3G,5,A great assortment of colored pencils! Definitely recommend! Great Assortment!

1397727,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Okay for children, these would work just fine. However, I was disappointed. You have to press hard for the colors to even be semi vibrant. I received a duplicate (only 1 at first glance), the packaging came torn, and some of the pencils are chipped up on the body. Colors are not vibrant and I would not recommend. Works, not worth it"
1397728,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great selection for color therapy.  Able to do more detail than regular crayons and not as messy as gel pens.  The devil is in the details. Great selection for color therapy

1397774,B001DKMZ3G,4,Very nice Four Stars
1397775,B001DKMZ3G,2,"The force you need to use to get any decent level of color off these pencils is pretty high. Im not a pencil artist expert, but my kids $5 crayola pencils do a much nicer job and provide a much more even and consistent color without using hulk-like force. On a positive note, the color selection is nice. So-so at best. Get a different brand."
1397776,B001DKMZ3G,2,"These pencils have suffered from the problem that so many ""school"" quality ones do - most of the leads are completely broken inside. I've had them for under a month and some of them are already down to just stubs because just about every time I sharpen them (carefully, using a hand-held sharpener), the lead falls out.

I'm looking into other options for my color-coding needs. You get what you pay for, I guess"

1397783,B001DKMZ3G,5,Returned. Five Stars
1397784,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Lovely colors with the usual stubby points made by a non-standard sharpener.  Easily corrected by my trusty, old pencil sharpener.  Then they can shade, as well as outline. Great colored pencils!"
1397786,B001DKMZ3G,1,These colored pencils are awful. Bought these for my daughter. Just getting around to sharpening these because they are not used often. I find it ridiculous that the lead breaks every time it's sharpened. I've sharpened them down to 1/3- 1/2 of the pencil on the first sharpen. Waste of money. Waste of money
1397787,B001DKMZ3G,4,Good for the price Four Stars
1397788,B001DKMZ3G,5,My grandkids love these. Five Stars
1397789,B001DKMZ3G,2,"These are okay, but not into the ""good"" category and I don't like them. That's twofold, the lead and the color options.
It's not unusual to want a scratch sheet inside to show the true color, so that doesn't bother me.
However, it's a hard-hard lead - you really have to press to get a bold color (or something that will not just fade completely away even at high-res scanning), it doesn't blend well with paper or cotton, and it shows the pencil marks badly, both light strokes and it dents paper when you're bearing down to get deep colors.
There are a LOT of very, very similar colors. You expect some of that with 50 packs, but this one is pretty bad and a lot of the really-close and repeat colors are in the pink-red and the yellow realms that I just don't use as much even for highlights or tinting markers and other pencil shades. It's worsened by the hard lead aspect - by the time you've put down enough lead/force, you're losing a lot of the subtlety that made it worth producing that color in the first place.

I like Sargent brand, I do. But either get the smaller packs to be sure, or - for real, even for arch students and definitely broadsheet art students - either pay for prismacolor or F-C (if you need/want good and lots of options that come from soft-soft lead), or just get a 24- or 36-pk Crayola set. With good hand control, the softer Crayolas will give you as much versatility as these with good hand control or by layering over grays, yellows, pinks and pale blue-greens to create different tones. Standards crayolas also blend better than these with sticks or cotton. Only ""meh"" - very hard lead, not that much color differentiation"
1397790,B001DKMZ3G,5,These work really well for me. I actually need a new set because Ive been coloring at work to keep my anxiety down and so they have been used quite a bit. These pencils DO wear down quickly so a good quality sharpener is a must. So far all of the pencils have sharpened beautifully with only one being a dud that kept breaking. The colors are vibrant and do an amazing job of bringing the pictures to life. I will be getting another set. Great quality for the price

You should not have to press hard to get the effect you want nor should you have to. You can't blend with them either. No matter what you do, it will not layer to darken. I am so glad that I did a test page before I ruined my sketch Don't waste your money on these"

1397804,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These coloured pencils were of ok quality better than a few other expensive brands that I have tried. However after sharpening a few of the pencils they seem to be rotted inside. The colors are vibrant , my favourite colours are the gold and silver .I was also disappointed that the pack didn't come with a recommended pencil sharpener . I have used these pencils for about a month before reviewing. Good coloured pencils"

1397807,B001DKMZ3G,5,"The Sargent line is usually a little more expensive than better-known brands like Crayola or Prang, but this pack of a dozen is a bargain, at present anyway.  Color of pencils are orange, brown, blue, violet, black, yellow, light green, dark green, dark red, rose pink, white, and light blue.  The ones I bought turned out to be unusually sturdy.  If a dozen colors are enough, this is a really good product. Oh Yeah!"

1397809,B001DKMZ3G,5,Gift to a coloring friend as I love Sargent for coloring. Great colored pencils

1397821,B001DKMZ3G,5,The family loves these.  We keep some in the car so we don't have to worry about crayons melting! Five Stars
1397822,B001DKMZ3G,5,Good colors. Five Stars
1397823,B001DKMZ3G,2,I must have got a bad batch because these set break easily especially when you have to sharpen them. The split just gets worst doesnt keep the lead in Eh
1397824,B001DKMZ3G,5,Colored lead seems harder and doesn't break once sharpened. Enjoying my coloring. Five Stars
1397825,B001DKMZ3G,5,My middle daughter loved this set. I ordered an adult coloring book to go with it. I have another budding artist. Love it.
1397826,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Absolutely love these pencils  right here, the color pops off the page and the pencils are so smooth Pencils"
1397827,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Good deal for colored pencils. The quality wasn't Prismacolor level, but as an occasional coloring book user, I don't really need such high quality coloring pencils. Still very good quality though, as I've also used the really cheapo colored pencils where you don't get the right texture of color transfer and such. These colored well, didn't require excessive pressure to get the color to transfer, and didn't get worn down so quickly that you had to resharpen frequently. Overall, pleased with these colored pencils. As of writing this review, the price has drastically dropped! I got them for $13 and thought it was a good deal, they're only $5 now! Good deal on good colored pencils for my amateur needs"
1397828,B001DKMZ3G,5,love this pencils. The colors are bright ... love it Five Stars
1397829,B001DKMZ3G,4,Bought these thrice. One for a friend and twice for my son. He lost one package and he really loved them so had to get another set. Great for school or play

1397836,B001DKMZ3G,4,Good for the price but the lead seems to break too much when sharpening. Four Stars
1397837,B001DKMZ3G,1,"It's soooooo HARD to color with these, OMG!!!! They're not smooth at all, the hue in each one is very faint even if you push really hard against the paper. Don't waste your money!"
1397838,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Super pigmented and colourful. I use them for adult colouring books and they work very well. Would buy again, but I doubt I will need to. Love!"
1397839,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Nice hard leads and the colors are beautiful -- not ""kiddie"" type. Five Stars"

1397848,B001DKMZ3G,5,Perfect Five Stars
1397849,B001DKMZ3G,1,"This set doesn't even contain the main colors that usually come in any other pencil set.  The color that appears on the box is not how it comes out on the paper.  All of them are very light and inaccurate.  I couldn't believe that there isn't even a red pencil, it's orange.  There are MANY different shades of green, however, most of them look the same.  The colors don't adhere to the paper well and they are very dull. This box of pencils is a huge disappointment.  Don't waste your money. Don't Bother"
1397850,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Good pencils, great assortment and my kids love them. Good"
1397851,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I should have read the reviews more carefully. The colors are light and not at all accurate, and I got 2 Mahogany pencils and no Rose color, so to me that means there's a quality control issue there as well. Our nice electronic pencil sharpener likes to eat these also - the silver came with a broken tip and when I went to sharpen it half the pencil was gone in a matter of seconds. I'll be letting my kids have these and getting better pencils for my own use. Don't waste your $!!"
1397853,B001DKMZ3G,5,I bought these to go along with an adult coloring book and had them delivered to my friend who had surgery and was bedridden. She loved them. Thanks for the great product & service. Worked great

1397869,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I love the pencils. They have great colors. They don't sharpen too well, but well enough for the price. You will need to buy or find a pencil box as the cardboard is flimsy and does not hold them in order. Great pencils for the price"
1397870,B001DKMZ3G,5,I got this for a friend of mine that is into coloring and he has been looking for gold and silver pencils and he couldn't find them.  this was a great find and had all he wanted.

1397877,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I usually do not write reviews. However I was so disappointed in these pencils I thought I should. They arrived on time and looking so promising. Sadly, the colors are not at all what they should be. In fact, 2 of the pencils are mislabeled. The ""Aqua Green"" is actually Dark Green(as dark as it can be...all the pencils lack vibrancy. ) And in turn, ""Dark Green"" is more a Kelly or Grass Green.

I am not at all a professional artist though I have been coloring almost daily for the last 2 years as a form of refocusing and stress reduction.  I tried these pencils on various types of paper. They were the same, washed out colors on my professional grade paper as they are on my son's construction paper.

I do not in any way see this as a reflection on Amazon. In the years I have been a customer, and through countless (seriously COUNTLESS) orders, i have been only been disappointed in a product 4-5 times. THATS A PRETTY AWESOME TRACK RECORD AMAZON!!!  However I was so disappointed in these pencils I thought I should"

1397881,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Many gorgeous colors, goes on smoothly and gives a lovely look much better than Crayola in my opinion. Only problem is the color on the pencil is different than that on paper, so testing then out on scratch paper first is smart. Very good, and great price!"
1397882,B001DKMZ3G,5,as expected. Five Stars

1397900,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Wonderful, great assorment of colors, good quality and good price... Very good."
1397902,B001DKMZ3G,5,"People who buy expensive artist quality pencils to color in coloring books have way too much money and not much sense. Sheeple there's always a less expensive product that's going to give you the same results. This is one of those products. Quality doesn't mean that you have to pay an arm and a leg for your supplies! Although I haven't bought from this supplier every time, this is the 6th box of these pencils I've bought. The only thing I don't like is the shabby box they come in and fall out into the shipping box. Hello? Ever heard of tape. Easy fix. Since I'm not going to be using them for something for an art class I'm not returning them but they seriously need to get a handle on the box. I also know I'll end up knocking them on the floor a few times before I use them up. I really like that you get 50 colors to blend and mix up with pens and markers whenever you're creating your masterpieces. FIFTY!!! Colors are listed on the back which is what sold me in the beginning because for some reason other companies want you to guess what colors are in their boxes. I like to know what I'm buying. They have white pencils to add highlights in the box too. I'm quite pleased with this product and I know that I'll buy it again! What's In Your Box?"
1397903,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great Five Stars

1397911,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I mean, they're five dollars, so I wasn't expecting much. They're good as light colors if you shade with something else. As others have said, the color variation stinks. I wish I had read the reviews first. Eh."

1397950,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I bought these as gifts for family. They haven't quite been bitten by the coloring bug like I have but they wanted to dabble. These are the best reasonably priced pencils I've tried! They are like Crayolas older more experienced brother. In fact, if you blindly handed me a Sargent pencil I might believe it was meant to be artist grade! I highly recommend these to beginning colorists because I would hate to see someone turned away from such an enjoyable hobby because of bad pencils. Highly recommend! I sneak and use my son's Sargent pencils while he's at school"

1397984,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I got these for use with an adult colouring book and they're a great set. The gold and silver are very soft and will break very easily, especially when sharpening. After one sharpening, they finished off about 1/4 their original size due to the tip constantly breaking as it got anywhere near sharp.  Other than that, I have no complaints about them!  I bought them again as part of a gift for a friend a few months later.  Good coloured pencils for a good price. Gold and silver are soft and break, but otherwise a great set."

She is as happy as can be, and I am happy that my pencil tips aren't broken when I go to use them. GREAT for a budding young artist"

1397998,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I ordered these last week, because they were an Amazon Add-On deal for $5.10.

My mom always said, ""You get what you pay for.""

At the price, these were 10-11 cents per pencil, so I figured I couldn't go wrong.

I keep a small 96 sketchbook, and color/write a sample of everything we buy, with the brand name, purchase date, price, and our rating, so I'll know what we liked, and didn't, and why.

I have 5 grandkids that come to my house after school almost every weekday, 3 girls, 2 boys, ages 5 to 13. We like to color, a lot. Everything from Disney Princess to dinosaurs, dragons, and monsters. The 11 and 12 year old girls are into the Crayola color escapes sets, which their mothers (my daughters) now want for birthday/Christmas this year for their own. The pictures they don't like, they give to the 13 and 8 year old boys, like the alligator, or pick-up truck. The 5 year old girl gets everything girly and pink. Everyone has their own stuff, but we also have community property of crayons, pencils, markers, paints, gel pens, etc. Anything I find for a good price, or whatever someone doesn't like in their personal stuff goes into the community boxes. I have my own private stash in my sewing room.

These pencils by Sargent will become community property for several reasons:

They are nice pencils, the leads don't break when you color, but occasionally do when writing.

They are a boxed set of 50, with 2 White, and 2 Black per the ad on Amazon, for 48 different colors. We don't use white, gray or black much. I put the extra black pencils at each phone extension to use for messages.

BUT - they also included 2 Yellow, and 2 Red-Orange. I took a star off for that. They were supposed to have a Red pencil, and a Light Yellow pencil in the package, which are missing.

The Gold and Silver pencils are dull. The Gold is more like an Antique Bronze, and the Silver is a dark Pewter. No one likes them. I'm trying to convince the 8 year old that dinosaurs really were those colors.

And the really bad news, 20 of the color names on the barrels don't have any relation at all to the lead color. I think these may be seconds, which explains the cheap price. Just as an example: the Cherry Red is a light Red-Orange. The Pink is more Rose. The Rose is really Magenta, and the Magenta is Red. The Light Violet is actually darker and more blue, than the Violet pencil. Of the 11 shades of Green, only 2 or 3 even match the color to the name. AND, there's no basic Green included. Although the pencils marked Dark Green and Light Green are both really Green, and are the same color lead. I took off 2 stars for the incorrect labeling.

I'll just color samples on small address labels (1"" .25"") and put them on the barrels, by the names. Then no one yells about why the pencil with a pink barrel is in the brown pencil case. Sargent Colored Pencils, 50 count"

1398001,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I actually really like these colored pencils. They do come with more green, which is actually why I ordered them, I like having extra, and different green colors for adult coloring. I found you need to have a good pencil sharpener for All brands of colored pencils, cheap sharpeners is what causes the tips to brake off. Soon as I got a wind sharpener, I had no tips braking off. I order two more sets of these pencils I like it that much. I actually really like these colored pencils"

1398005,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Good quality for laying down color. Color however is not very true to traditional expectation for some such as olive, tan, salmon, maize, yellow orange. The outsides of the pencils aren't very true to color either. Hence making a chart. Good quality, not color true"
1398006,B001DKMZ3G,4,"This is an excellent product and great quality to the end of usage!

1398025,B001DKMZ3G,4,bought 3 boxes for grandkids and they work great good for adult/teen color books
1398026,B001DKMZ3G,5,"When these arrived, I felt tiny wave of nostalgia as I remembered how excited I was as a child when I got a new box of crayons.  Well, I felt the same way today when I got these, but these are tools for grown-ups.  I was a bit surprised as to how large and impressive the selection looked when I took it out of the shipping box; sometimes profile pictures just don't do justice.

I do some drawing for relaxation and I've decided to move beyond black and white and study the use of color.  These pencils are just the right thing for the job; they're comfortable in my hand and easy to manipulate.

The colors are vivid and the lead moves smoothly across the page.  It's very easy to be precise and they feel like quality instruments in your hands.  It has been a very rewarding and soothing experience using these. The Kids Will Be Jealous!"
1398027,B001DKMZ3G,5,"good stuff, great price Five Stars"
1398028,B001DKMZ3G,5,"They smoothly put down a nice color that, in my mind, is perfectly vivid.  (I find many Prismacolor pencils color a little too brightly/vividly for my taste.)

1398166,B001DKMZ3G,5,Decent selection of pencils Colored pencils
1398167,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I enjoy these coloring pencils. The colors are interesting and vibrant. The pencils are sturdy with no breaks or unwelcomed lead breakage. The colors are all listed in the back with a sample of the color as well. The reason for 4 stars instead of 5 is because I like to keep my things fairly organized and easily accessible and these are a bit hard to use while in the box. But that is Strickland a preference of mine. I have another set I purchased and it comes in a nice tin where all the colors are visible and easily pulled from the tin.  I would need to put these in a fat tin to be able to look at them all at once and read the color name. But again, that is nearly the packaging and not the product. Great pencils!"
1398168,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These are good quality pencils. Many colors to choose from, though some are so close, I am not sure the color is different. Great quality and price"

1398172,B001DKMZ3G,5,This is a great set of colored pencils. They are not top of the line. But I would say they are somewhere in the middle. They work well and have very nice colors. They are a good addition to any art set. Great for adult coloring books and many other projects. A Very Nice Set of Colored Pencils.

1398189,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I'm loving these color pencils. They shade well and offer plenty of color options for the adult user or someone wanting more natural colors. the glide is smooth without catching and you can darken the colors just by continuing to apply more color. The colors also allow blending of two or more colors for even more versatility.

I was surprised at how good of pencils they were. For the price, I was not expecting much but I highly recommend the Sargent Art Premium Coloring Pencils 50 Pack to anyone looking to get into coloring or already an artist. Excellent Colors and Smooth Use"

These are more color pencils that you would give to someone so that they have a bit of a wider and more mature color range than with Crayola or RoseArt (they can be pretty bright, and both brands can break easily while sharpened), but you still aren't ready to spend big bucks on some fancy professional color pencils.

1398458,B001DKMZ3G,4,Nice pencils for the price.  Decent color saturation.  Lead not as soft as higher end brands and require more effort to blend effectively.

1398461,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I use these every single day in my bullet journal. Love the variety of colors and that they are erasable to a degree, as I like to lighten certain areas and shade others. They sharpen well too, which is always something I look for. I hate the cheap wood ones that splinter and never sharpen up. So far, I have had nothing but a good experience with this set, Great for Journaling!"

1398469,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I know you get what you pay for but these are not worth the money. They color down too fast, have very little pigment payoff and are just not worth it. If you or your children use colored pencils for art, spend more and get good ones, these are junk. Bad color payoff"
1398470,B001DKMZ3G,4,Good range of colors. My kids love the range of shades available. Good range of colors
1398471,B001DKMZ3G,1,Horrible. My little boy was so excited. We opened it up and the batteries and metal pieces are all corroded. Horrible. My little boy was so excited

1398491,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I purchased the 24 pack of colored pencils. If you're not a serious coloring person, these are great. However, the majority of the pencils, after being used, when they needed to be sharpened, fell apart, repeatedly, in the sharpener.  I thought perhaps it was the sharpener, so I tried another, but the same thing happened.  I even had a friend try to sharpen a couple pencils for me, in case the problem was me.  Nope, these colored pencils don't seem to be up to adult coloring standards, at least for me.  Might be good for kids though. Sub-standard for Adult Coloring"
1398492,B001DKMZ3G,5,High quality. I took it for my son. High quality.

1398507,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I was upset that my box came ripped. I contacted Amazon and they instantly refunded me which was great because this was meant to be a gift. So I tried the color pencils and I did like them, they're smooth and pretty. Some colors seem to be the same but when you press hard you can tell a slight deference. Color pencils, bad packaging."
1398508,B001DKMZ3G,5,Very soft leads are great for smooth coloring and sharpen nicely for fine lines in adult coloring book. So ar these are the best colored pencils I have found other than the very expensive art pencils purchased singly from the art store.

1398545,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These are colored pencils. Nothing extra special about them really. One good thing I can say about them is that I have a heavy hand when coloring, and tend to break the points off. This did not happen with these. They are good quality in that sense. Strong but basic"

1398607,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Very nice colors are included. I wish I would have gotten 50 different colors instead of 2 of every color. Needs a stronger package. The cardboard is very unsupportive. I got a storage container for me. When I received them ,the pencils were all ove the box. However, they work well and cover the page nicely.

1398616,B001DKMZ3G,4,Seem pretty nice. Wishing some of the basic colors where more closely related. But only used once so far to help my son with a school project that required family participation. Debating it it's worth the price. Nice pencils

1398634,B001DKMZ3G,4,Good accessory for the adult coloring books I got for my granddaughter. The whole family got involved. Good accessory for coloring books for those beyond 4th grade.
1398635,B001DKMZ3G,5,I love to draw. I go through pencils like there is no tomorrow. This inexpensive package of pencils had many colors and the leads are soft enough to draw deep rich colors. 50 colors for few dollars? sign me up!

1398639,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Very nice quality pencil, the colors are a little mismatched, for example the olive green is more of a bright lime green. My biggest beef is the duplicates; two blacks and two whites, perhaps more, but those are the two I've found this far. I'd rather have a couple more shades of, say the red color spectrum, than duplicates, but I'm still very happy with this purchase. Has duplicates"

1398669,B001DKMZ3G,5,Decided to buy because my son stole all my Crayola brand colored pencils. I an not an artist so all I can tell you is that they do what I need them to do. Good amount for the price.

1398675,B001DKMZ3G,4,"they seem very nice, but very poor packaging, when i received them they were all scattered across the box with other items in it, and they wouldn't really fit right inside the box after i rearranged them all good prodcut, bad packaging"
1398676,B001DKMZ3G,5,Very nice and the way it glides across paper. My husband will love them. Smoothe and silky
1398677,B001DKMZ3G,1,"Because of the good reviews, I was hoping for a great set of coloring pencils but was disappointed. You do get 50 pencils however there are 2 blacks and 2 whites and 10 different shades of green and 9 different shades of blue. There is no true purple but there are 3 different shades of violet. There are 3 shades of red, 3 of orange, 4 of yellow, 3 of pink, 4 of brown, 4 skin tones, 1gray, 1 silver and 1 gold. If you are going to put 50 coloring pencils together, at least have a wider variety of colors and don't double up on a couple of the colors. I don't really care for how they color either. The colors are not all that vibrant. Here's hoping PrismaColor has a great sale at some point. ;) Needs a better variety of color"
1398678,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Colours are somehow uninspiring and not ""punchy"" enough, but quality product nonetheless. Four Stars"
1398679,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Great starter set for my first foray into the world of adult coloring books, and the value for the price was huge! Now that I'm hooked,  just may need to upgrade for more colors but very happy with this Great value"
1398680,B001DKMZ3G,4,great price Four Stars
1398681,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Great pencils, I bought them for my grandchildren with coloring books for Christmas.  They always use mine so, I decided to buy them their own. Great pencils and price with lots of colors."
1398682,B001DKMZ3G,2,The colors are way too similar. I'd upgrade to less colors in a better brand. You actually will get more differentiated colors. Colors too similar
1398683,B001DKMZ3G,5,My grandchildren love these Nice
1398684,B001DKMZ3G,2,Poor color payoff. Two Stars
1398685,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great colored pencils. They seem to last a long time even though you sharpen them a lot. Great colors and easy to use. Colors Galore

1398691,B001DKMZ3G,5,love Five Stars
1398692,B001DKMZ3G,5,Lots of great colors. They will be perfect for an upcoming project. Nice
1398694,B001DKMZ3G,2,You get what you pay for. The quality of these pencils are sub par. Wishing I'd forked out a little extra cash for better quality. The pencils are extremely light no matter how hard you press or how many times you go over the same spot. Not great.
1398696,B001DKMZ3G,5,my mother in law loves them. she does adult coloring gift for mom
1398697,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These are great. I bought these to accompany my

1398701,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Great product, great price! Five Stars"
1398702,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I really like this set, especially for the price. But the colors aren't exactly what you would expect. For example, ""peach"" looks more like a bright tan. For some reason, there are two ""white"" pencils, and there are tons of shades of brown and green. It would be nice to have a wider selection of reds and blues, for example. Also, the package came open during shipment and the pencils spilled out into the box, breaking a lot of the tips so they had to be sharpened immediately. So you won't be storing the pencils in the box it comes in. Overall, a good value for the price paid. A nice selection of colors"
1398703,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Great colors and quality! I bought these as a gift, and the recipient was super happy with them. Five Stars"
1398704,B001DKMZ3G,1,I think these were so inexpensive because they are rejects. I ordered 3 boxes and the names of the colors are the same but the colors are not even close to each other from box to box. The red looks brown in one box. The tips were broken on several of them Poor Colors
1398705,B001DKMZ3G,1,"Product arrived in pieces, fallen out of the mangled box.  This was supposed to be a Christmas gift.  Thoroughly disappointed. Thoroughly disappointed."
1398706,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I was really excited to see this product at such a great price, but upon arrival, I was disappointed to see the box opened and the pencils loose and rolling around with the other items I had ordered. Several were broken. I ordered these for my personal use, since my children had put my other set to use at school, and am disappointed to say that these are going straight to the crayon/marker/pencil box for the kids. ... really excited to see this product at such a great price, but upon arrival"
1398707,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great product especially considering the price value ratio. Five Stars

1398712,B001DKMZ3G,1,Not dark or vibrant colors needed for adult coloring. Colors not vibrant.
1398713,B001DKMZ3G,1,Only came with 30 pencils. Missing half the pencils
1398714,B001DKMZ3G,5,Ups delivered to a under construction part of the house (called it a rear door) instead of the main door of our home which has 3 steps and a ramp and chair to place boxes on plus a covered area. To protect in weather. The boxes were soaked. Not happy. I had to carry inside around lumber upstairs with heavy soaked boxes. I cannot complain to ups maybe Amazon can! I think it was a sub driver. Not happy. I had to carry inside around lumber upstairs ...
1398715,B001DKMZ3G,4,Vibrant colors! Great stocking stuffer
1398716,B001DKMZ3G,5,Received on time and as advertised. Christmas gift

1398720,B001DKMZ3G,5,Ordered this case on a whim and I absolutely love it! Well worth the price for a slim case that feels very protective of my phone! Will definitely buy again!! Very nice!

1398726,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Got these for classroom art projecys. Durable and cheap, they stand up to vigorous teenaher scribbling. Good deal for durable supplies"
1398727,B001DKMZ3G,5,These colored pencils are just ok. They work and color nicely however not a great variety in colors. Alot of colors look the same in the box so this is frustrating when trying to use different colors when coloring and keep pulling out colors you think you haven't used yet but then when you put it on paper it's very similar to color already used. Not good variety of colors
1398728,B001DKMZ3G,2,It may work for some but my created wouldn't eat this. He is used to repashi so it may be that he is used to that. It may work for some but my created wouldn't eat ...
1398729,B001DKMZ3G,1,"Came out of the box, half the pencils broken. Box not taped and ripped. Bad shipping quality"

1398731,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Watch out, these may fall out of the box in shipping! but otherwise high quality, minus the box. Gift"
1398732,B001DKMZ3G,5,great Five Stars
1398733,B001DKMZ3G,5,Pencils are sturdy and seem well made.  No issues with lead breakage or other problems.  They go one smoothly and are responsive to pressure adjustments and blending.  Great for kids or adults. Pencils are sturdy and seem well made
1398734,B001DKMZ3G,5,Nice Five Stars
1398735,B001DKMZ3G,4,Good color selection and nice feel when used for adult coloring book but the quality is just okay to good. Excellent compared with the price but just alright independent of their good value. Nice for an adult coloring book though. Great for the price but no one thought these are for professionals
1398737,B001DKMZ3G,5,Oh the colors! Five Stars
1398738,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These are great pencils; I like them better than the crayola ones I have. The lead is really sturdy and doesn't break easily under the pressure of my 6 yr old son who colors very hard. They also sharpen very well without breaking. Huge color variety too (esp happy with silver & gold pencils) Overall, I am thrilled! These are high quality pencils!"
1398739,B001DKMZ3G,1,Cheap box had come apart before arrival. Unable to give as gift One Star
1398740,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great set of colored pencils with a variety of colors and easily sharpened without cracking or breaking. Nice starter pack!

1398743,B001DKMZ3G,4,"these are OK pencils but they don't darken/lighten with pressure like a good set of Prang pencils. These are for beginner coloring folks, not those who blend colors. ... are OK pencils but they don't darken/lighten with pressure like a good set of Prang pencils"
1398744,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I am disappointed with these after I read all the great reviews. Some of the colors, although say they are different shades, are the SAME shade!!! Most of the greens and all of the darker blues. Same Shades"
1398745,B001DKMZ3G,4,Very many colors and they work like a professional artists Four Stars
1398746,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Great colored pencils if you are on a budget. I have just upgraded from Crazy Art and I am very satisfied with my purchase
1.

March 1, 2017, I am changing my rating on these pencils,  after using these pencils they are the poor quality compared to  Prang. I have purchased a box of prang pencils and the quality is far better than the sergeant. The sergeant pencils tend to drag when coloring and they are also very hard to blend. They do come in beautiful and a wide variety of colors. I probably will not re-purchase these pencils. Sometimes I just pull a color from my stack and I can always tell when I have pulled a sergeant color, it drags and won't blend very well. They also will not layer either.  Earlier I said I upgraded, but the truth is these pencils are equal to crazy art, just come in more colors. Was not impressed"
1398747,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Like these pencils a lot, great product. Five Stars"
1398748,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I'm excited about the wide color variety however, what I received is below what I expected. As a customer I would have never purchased this product at a store in this condition. I expect new/undamaged products when I received it. Not only did I only get 49/50 color pencils but also the box was ripped. Very disappointed. Very disappointed."
1398749,B001DKMZ3G,5,Good quality. Five Stars
1398750,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Not soft enough. Not pigmented and color is not saturated at all. I had to press so hard to have some color out. It's good for kids to play with, but for serious coloring projects in adults? I am returning. Very hard pencils"
1398751,B001DKMZ3G,5,My 13yr old loves them. Five Stars
1398753,B001DKMZ3G,5,good selection of colors gift
1398754,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great deal! Five Stars
1398755,B001DKMZ3G,4,This pack has a nice variety of colors.  The names of the colors are listed on the pencils which is a great help to me.  The only complaint I have is that the lead is a bit hard.  They work well for coloring in tiny spaces but I prefer the feel of a soft pencil. Great starter set
1398756,B001DKMZ3G,4,"The pencils are nice for their price. I did not expect anything amazing - 50 colored pencils for under $7 isn't bad when you're just trying to add variety to your set. And I admit, the packaging makes them appear more professional than they are.

However, the colors do not match their barrels. Which is a little frustrating because I make a lot of decisions based on the barrel color - with these I will have to test the color separately before using them. I included a picture to show the extreme difference between the barrel and the actual color. The barrel for red shows a dark rich red, while the lead is lighter and brighter. I took off 2 stars for that, but added one back because you can't beat the price.

None came broken, the leads are all intact (so far). The draw a little rough, some of them aren't even as smooth as a Crayola pencil, while others are smoother. They did not have any strong smells, which was great. Overall, I am glad to include them in my colored pencil roundup. The pencils are nice for their price"
1398758,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I like these pencils, but the packing was awful.  My pencils were open and spilled all over the box!  This is my second set of Sargents.  I like them because I color alot of landscape type pictures. The have a nice variety of greens and earthtones that I use in my coloring. Good pencils, terrible packing!"
1398759,B001DKMZ3G,4,Super nice colors and perfect for kids. Nice price. Four Stars
1398760,B001DKMZ3G,4,These colored pencils come in a great variety of colors. I was very pleased with this purchase. Great product
1398761,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These are pretty good as the price was good, but stick to a brand locally that you KNOW is good.  I found that the lead in the box I received would break easily and would not sharpen properly.  Perhaps the box I received was damaged during the shipment process somewhere (case was dropped) thus breaking the leads inside.  Colors were okay.  I personally like Crayola a little better, but was looking for some different and new colors. Lead pencils for coloring....okay"
1398762,B001DKMZ3G,4,I ORDERED THIS PRODUCT AS A GIFT. THE PERSON I GAVE IT TO DID TELL ME THEY LIKED IT AND IT FIT THEIR NEEDS. THE PERSON I GAVE IT TO DID TELL ME THEY LIKED IT AND IT FIT THEIR NEEDS

1398768,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These are priced right or maybe i should say ""you get  what you pay for "".  I purchssed this for the Secret Garden, but used it also for the Victorian Hossie.  It status 50 koloru but you really get 48.  2 black & 2 white.  Not a great variation od koloru.  A lot a greens, So it works well for a garden, there are a lot of leaves  but what about  the flowers. Durable - good price."

1398773,B001DKMZ3G,5,"A VERY good value for the price! What a great set if someone is just getting into coloring! There are just enough variation of colors (several other commenters have listed the colors, so I won't) to complete any landscape or drawing. It is a compact and travel ready set. I have used a power sharpener and suggest a hand held one. Although, I haven't lost one lead so far, no broken tips or fractured lead that just falls out when you go to use it. I agree with another commenter that, you do have to use varying pressure to get the desired effect for some colors but, that is the same way my other, way more expensive,  pencils work. Maybe a better set for an older user than kids. I highly recommend this set especially at the 'add on' price! I have NOT been compensated in any way for this review. A VERY good value for the price! The perfect set for someone just starting to color..."

1398795,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I bought these for an adult coloring book when they were priced at $12 bucks and I deeply regret it. You do get variety but the color quality is just not there. In order to get a truly pigmented payoff, one is pressing so hard its seems like the pencil will break. I was expecting vibrant colors and they payoff was dismal. I would not recommend.

1398803,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great set my niece loved them. Great set and price
1398804,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great thank you Five Stars
1398805,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Decent pencils, presharpened, with 48 colors to choose from (white and black have 2 each). It's a nice set, but with that many colors, it's hard to distinguish between some of them, and the painted color on the pencils doesn't seem to match too well with the actual color the pencil produces. So, if you are trying to find the color you used in one place to use it again somewhere else, you really have to keep track of which pencil you used. But, that being said, I just got this for fun, not for any serious art endeavors, so they suit my needs, and the similar shades serve as backup for their neighbors. Also, seems like you have to press pretty hard to get a bold color.  Oh, and the box is pretty flimsy when the top is opened, so I'm looking for a better case to work out of. But for the price, I'm giving it 4 stars. OK pencils, and a good price"

I am so happy in purchasing these coloring pencils and recommend everyone who loves coloring to use these. The colors are beautiful. Absolutely beautiful"
1398820,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Ever since the ""adult coloring book"" craze has rocked the world, colored pencils prices have skyrocketed! This came highly recommended and 5 bucks cheaper than in any store. Have to admit, have spent hours coloring with these and they are by far the best I've purchased. Great range of colors, great craftmanship and great quality overall. If you've just gotten into the coloring mix, pick these up, they are worth every buck. Best colored pencils yet!"

1398859,B001DKMZ3G,2,"they are great pencils but do not work on the ""waxed"" paper of today's adult coloring books.. I recommend liquid gel or sharpies instead if that's what you're buying there.

We were given a refund, asked not to return the product so donated them to a school nearby NOt good for grown up Coloring books"

A lot of the blues, although are labeled different colors, come out extremely similar on paper regardless of how hard you press. For the price, you get a good variety.

1398886,B001DKMZ3G,4,"A very nice quality set of colored pencils to add to your collections. The set has several colors that seem hard to find (lavender tones). The pencils are of good quality and hold up to sharpening well. The lead is more of a hard lead, which makes it more difficult to get a deep saturation of color which can be frustrating. If you increase pressure to get the deeper color, the point tends to break. On the other hand, since the pencils seem to offer light and midrange color, it makes the set great for shading and ombre color. I would definitely buy the set again. A very nice quality set of colored pencils to add to your ..."

1398914,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I bought this because the video showed ""how much better"" these pencils were than ""any other brand"", and because the video showed that it contained a 'blending pencil' that could blend your colors.  I paid $3.50 more for this pack over the Crayola 50 pack that had a built in sharpener.  I should have saved my money.  They are no better than Crayola, and only slightly better than Rose Art.  There is no blending pencil!  I feel cheated and am extremely disappointed.  I thought a video would be truthful and added merit to the item, but I was wrong.  Save your money and buy Crayola!  They're just as good as these stupid things! Save your money!"
1398915,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These were the first -- and only -- coloring pencils I bought for adult coloring.  There are two areas in which they could be better.  I cannot get a vibrant color: the colors are mostly very pale.  Sharpening is a problem.  When I use the hand-held I never get a sharp point.  When I use the electric sharpener I get a better point but lose a bit more of the pencil.  Nevertheless, I really like this assortment.  Very usable colors.

1398921,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Not the absolute best quality pencils from an artistic stand point, but a good range of colors and the right quality for the price point. Some have streaky color, others are nice and full, but what do you expect for a lower price point? Great for casual coloring"

They were very well sharpened and had a nice feel.  It was the colors that were the problem.  I ordered from a different company.  I got those today and the colors seem more true.  They were not sharpened as well. Not Great."

1398945,B001DKMZ3G,2,"There is no difference between light green and dark green (light blue and dark blue, etc). When you're coloring this kind of detail - you need them to be distinguished. As such you really have closer to 12 different colors than 24. Will not be purchasing again (they'll be given to my kids) while a try to find a product with true colors. No difference between ""light' and ""dark"" colors"

1398951,B001DKMZ3G,4,Good selection of colors. I just wish the pigment was better because I really have to push down on on the pencils to get the richness I want. The colors blend well but it leaves the paper indented. Good selection of colors
1398952,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Great Quality...All came safe and unbroken.  Such a convenience to get office / school supplies delivered to your door! Quality, Low Price, Convenience!"

1398963,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Very light in colors. You have to really press to get the color to show. A lot of the same colors with different names, like 5 greens, 4 blues and the colors are slightly maybe half a shade different. I felt like I got maybe only 10 pencil colors, in multiple names. I thought, I'd receive a variety of colors with 50 pencils. Not what I was expecting"

1398969,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I love these pencils. I bought these at another store and paid a few dollars more. I loved them so much I had to check Amazon to see if they had them. I found them for less money and ordered two more sets. There are 50 pencils in this set but there are two black and two white pencils. I considered ordering the larger set but after reading the reviews, found that set is mostly doubles. My only problem is, I wish there were more colors. The are very soft pencils and blend very well. I love these pencils"

1398975,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Recently got into coloring for grown ups, and after trying out colored markers, decided to give colored pencils a try. Compared to the pencils I remember as a kid, these Sargent Art pencils are very nice for the money. You get a wide range of colors to work with, and they lay down pleasing pastel hues. As they don't bleed like markers can, they give me more control.  Don't know about some of the color names they selected (the ""Cherry Red"" doesn't look so).  They sharpen to a fine point (I also bought the Prismacolor Scholar sharpener on Amazon for a couple bucks) which is just what I need to stay in the lines.  :) Nice quality starter set"
1398976,B001DKMZ3G,5,Grand daughter needed these for school.  Exactly what she needs! Great colored pencils

1398987,B001DKMZ3G,5,I've finally upgraded from dollar store my little pony coloring books to super detailed adult coloring books and have been agonizing because I needed seriously 5 shades of green just to do it justice.  This box does the trick! Finally so many colors!

1398995,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I'm not sure how I feel about these pencils - they are a hard lead which I like but I got two ""white"" color pencils in the pack.  Also some of the colors are not true color.  The red is more of a dark pink, the dark purple is actually a light violet, there are several ""green"" colors that practically look the same and the 'maize' color is actually a brown.  With that being said, they do have a fairly smooth lay down and the point lasts for a long time.  They are better than Prang but not as nice as some old Sanford Colorific pencils I have. So - So Value"
1398996,B001DKMZ3G,5,Excellent Five Stars
1398997,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These pencils are pretty easy to color my adult coloring book and the colors are nice.  There isn't a big difference in the shades of some of the color classes (e.g., in some cases, the blues almost match each other.)  I may look for some pencils that have a greater variety of colors and shades.  Other than that, they do 'color' nicely, covering the area I want to color without streaks or imparting different shades. Nice Colored Pencils"

1399058,B001DKMZ3G,4,They make colors when pressed against paper! BOOM!
1399059,B001DKMZ3G,1,I bought these because they got such great reviews. I never leave negative reviews because I am usually never disappointed in a highly rated product. I honestly can't believe how terrible these pencils are! There are hard spots in the cores that don't wear down properly with use. They don't color or sharpen evenly (even with a high quality sharpener). The pigment in these is almost nonexistent. I have to color layer after layer to get any kind of color payoff and it's still not satisfactory. I honestly don't understand all these positive reviews... Haven't any of you ever used colored pencils before? Because these ones don't count. These don't qualify as colored pencils
1399060,B001DKMZ3G,5,Got these for stocking stuffers for my adult kids! Five Stars
1399061,B001DKMZ3G,5,lost of colors to pring out the artist in me. just as described.

1399063,B001DKMZ3G,4,okay Four Stars
1399064,B001DKMZ3G,2,"The colours aren't as vibrant as I would have expected them to be. There is also like 6 different green's but no turqouise, they do the job, but if you want better quality, I would buy something else. There is also like 6 different green's but no turqouise"
1399065,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I own a number of different types of colored pencils and wanted to try Sargent pencils to see what I thought of them.

What I found was that in the pack of 50, you really only get 48 different colors.  You get two each of the white and the black.  Otherwise, the color selection is really quite good.

The lead is hard in these pencils.  Because of that, I had to use multiple layers of color to get the pigment deeper.  That worked well but was a little hard on my elbow by the time I finished.

For someone who is interesting in coloring but doesn't want to invest a lot, this could be a good starter set.  If you are looking for a softer lead pencil, this may not be the best choice. A harder lead pencil with lighter pigment but a great value"
1399066,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I was worried when I first bought these, that the color wouldn't be vibrant enough for the adult coloring books. These proved me wrong, they work great for what I purchased them for. They come sharpened, and are easy to fit in the fine lines of the adult coloring books. My only complaint is that some of the colors are very similar to each other. All in all though this is a great product. Great product for adult coloring books"

1399071,B001DKMZ3G,5,Nice Five Stars
1399072,B001DKMZ3G,2,colors are not a deep as Crayola pencils. I like Crayola pencils better. They are a deeper richer color than these
1399073,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I don't like these pencils at all.  Although it is possible to build color, it is never vibrant.  The color is very flat and matte.  I went over sections over and over to no avail.  Very disappointing given their cost.  The color selection is good but what good is that if the colors aren't vibrant on the page?
The pencils from Target and / Crayola are actually more vibrant than these. Not vibrant at all.  Not what expected given other reviews"
1399074,B001DKMZ3G,5,Bought two sets and will buy more. Perfect fit for the new Adult/Grownup coloring books. Good buy

1399102,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I like them. Vibrant colors. Wish there was more variety, but I knew what I was buying. Only complaint, they feel like they have a wax in them and it makes it difficult to get deeper color out of them. I have to press really hard to intensify my colors. Good pencils, just difficult to get variety of color"

1399106,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These pencils serve their purpose. I bought them for the adult coloring books I ordered, and I'm happy. I'm not looking for professional pencils so the lack of bold colors doesn't bother me. However, if you're looking for vibrant and vivid colors, these pencils aren't for you. Adequate"
1399107,B001DKMZ3G,4,Lots of colors. Some of them didn't sharpen well. They would have the tip keep breaking. Four Stars

1399110,B001DKMZ3G,5,Exactly as described arrived in timely fashion Five Stars
1399112,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I've been very satisfied with these regarding their saturation, durability, and sharpening ease.  My various pencil sharpeners (hand-held and battery-powered) have damaged pencils of various brands (most notably Verithins), but these Sargent Art pencils consistently sharpen flawlessly to a sharp point--evenly and without breakage.  I'm giving them four--rather than five--stars only because they are not quite as buttery smooth or saturated as my Prismacolor Premiers or my Crayola Longs.  I've made color charts on various papers in order to compare these Sargent Arts with Prismacolor (Premiers and Verithins) and Crayola Longs, and shared those charts for an opinion on saturation and burnishing.  These are not quite as bright and do not burnish quite as well as the other two brands, but it took a keen eye to tell the difference.  They also require a little more hand pressure on some papers.  But for the money I consider them an outstanding buy.  Sharp, sharp points and not a single broken lead after much heavy use. Very satisfactory"
1399113,B001DKMZ3G,5,"My seven year old son loves coloring and this pencil set is fantastic. He has been frustrated in the past with trying to sharpen his colored pencils, only to have the led fall out as soon as he tries to color with them. These don't do that! Very nice set"
1399114,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Beautiful array of colors, the kids love them. Five Stars"
1399115,B001DKMZ3G,5,Daughter loves them! Five Stars
1399116,B001DKMZ3G,1,"These pencils are absolute garbage!! You have to press so hard to get good color coverage that you get a shine and are unable to blend colors. Don't waste your money!!! I wish I could give a negative number of stars, they don't even deserve a zero. These shouldn't even be sold by Amazon they are such poor quality. Buy Crayola if you want wax based pencils, or better yet, buy oil based for better blending. I ended up throwing these pencils away they were so useless. Warning: absolute garbage.

1399119,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These pencils would be fine for children to play with, but not for any sort of artistic work.  The colors are quite hard, so they don't color in very evenly.  For the price, they are a fine pencil and the color selection is great. These pencils would be fine for children to play with"

1399127,B001DKMZ3G,5,The colored pencils were all in good shape after shipping.  Many beautiful colors. Colorful pencils
1399128,B001DKMZ3G,4,These are very good pencils.  They are easy to sharpen and do not break.  Their colors are not quite as bright as Prismacolor but neither is the cost as high. They last longer because they are slightly harder than the Prismacolor are. For the money I find the pencils are a very good buy.  They are especially good for beginners in the coloring book craze. Good Buy
1399129,B001DKMZ3G,5,Perfect for a coloring book. Nice pencils

1399142,B001DKMZ3G,5,Awesome colors. Five Stars
1399143,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I got these as a gift along with an adult coloring book. I am not an artist, I appreciate the artist person that wrote about the clay content, that was interesting. I simply love color and putting colors together. I give 4 stars because I don't have a red as red as I would like. Depending on the finish of the paper I am coloring on the red comes out anywhere from dark orange to light red, but not red red.  I'm sure there is a purple missing as well. Maybe I just need to know more about pencils. :) Like them very much"
1399144,B001DKMZ3G,2,They don't color the way I expected. Two Stars

1399152,B001DKMZ3G,5,These are great for adult coloring books! The colors go on the paper smooth and are vibrant. I have the complete 150 pencil set of Prismacolor premier pencils but I wanted cheaper pencils for my coloring books. I only like using prismacolors for drawing because that's what they're made for. I do recommend Sargent colored pencils just for coloring. They're a good cheap set! These are great for adult coloring books
1399153,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great quality Five Stars
1399154,B001DKMZ3G,5,"really awesome pencils. i love the fact that the pack also has metallic colours in them and that on each pencil it has the name of the colour, so you know exactly how its going to look when you use them. i got two sets, one for me and one for my mum, we both love them, and will have to get more in the future wicked pencils"
1399155,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great pencils for the adult coloring books. I got these to go with the coloring book (see previous post). Great collection
1399157,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These are good for coloring books, they are soft pencils so I don't have to press too hard. The price is reasonable also. Nice Pencils"
1399158,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Bought these for my 8 yr old granddaughter, along with a fashion coloring book. She loves both! Five Stars"
1399159,B001DKMZ3G,5,"The colors of the pencils were very wide ranging and bright. When sharpening the pencils the colored ""lead"" didn't break and was ablt to sharpen to a point nicely. The selection for the price was quite good in my opinion. Good color selection"

1399163,B001DKMZ3G,5,Package arrived quickly. Nice durable pencils. One thing I found hard with some colored pencils is the colored piece would fall out. These ones are awesome. They don't do that at all. Nice durable pencils

1399168,B001DKMZ3G,1,A lot of colors are almost the same...and do not reflect the outside color. Won't purchase again. Bad colors
1399169,B001DKMZ3G,2,These pencils need several strokes to color with comfortably. Would be nice if they were softer. Color too hard.

1399174,B001DKMZ3G,4,My favorite product. Love it! And such a great deal too. I'd definitely recommend. Amazing! It was exactly as described
1399175,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These are better than the Crayola colored pencils that I grew up with because the harder leads allow for a more even coloration on the paper. I hated how hard it was to blend the Crayola colored pencils once you started. You don't have to be as careful about pressure or direction of coloring with the Sargent ones. They don't allow for an extremely vibrant coloring experience but the color is even and that is more important to me. They arrived in perfect condition with no broken tips, which was pleasing to me. These are better than the Crayola colored pencils that I grew up ..."
1399176,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great quality pencils. My daughter uses them for adult coloring books and loves them. Great quality item
1399177,B001DKMZ3G,5,good value Five Stars
1399178,B001DKMZ3G,1,"Worst ever! I was looking for a cost effective product and you get what you pay for. The colors on the outside of the pencils are no where near their actual color. And, the names of the colors aren't anywhere near accurate. Magenta = hot pink....what??? What's funny is I actually just googled magenta to see if I've been wrong about the definition all these years before writing the review. And, most of the colors are like that. You never know what your getting until it hits the paper. I started looking at the 'lead' only to have some idea what the color will be, but sometimes I sit in low light and would love to be able to read what the color is and not try to guess. These are the worst. It's a guess every time what color will end up on the paper!"
1399179,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Great for relaxation. It goes so well with the adult coloring books Color and relax. It,s therapeutic."
1399180,B001DKMZ3G,5,I love the round barrels.  They are easier on my hand.  These pencils work great for adult coloring books.  They have a softer core than some of the others pencils I have used in the past.  These pencils sharpen well without breaking the core.  I use a simple hand held sharpener and it works great.  I am able to get nice sharp point.  I will definitely order these again. Love these colored pencils.
1399181,B001DKMZ3G,5,didnt come broken or anything. they're in great shape and last long! theyre in great shape and last long
1399182,B001DKMZ3G,5,"So many colors! So much coloring to do! I've been looking for some great coloring pencils, ones that I do not have to spend a lot of money on like Prismacolor. Now granted I'm not saying these are on par with Prismacolor but I am saying that these are pretty nice coloring pencils and their colors are pretty true to their packaging. I enjoy coloring as a way of relaxation and these are a great addition to my coloring supplies. So much coloring to be done now!"

1399193,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Great color pencils, they color in nice. Gets the job done. The only thing I have to say is that they break easily when you sharpen the pencil, it could be the sharpener though. Either than that a good 50 color pencil set and a decent price. Great color pencils"
1399195,B001DKMZ3G,5,Work well but recommend the purchase of gel pens instead.... Five Stars
1399196,B001DKMZ3G,2,I simply do not like the colors of these pencils. Two Stars

1399199,B001DKMZ3G,5,great selection of colors Five Stars
1399200,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Photo is not a valid depiction of the actual shades in the 50-pencil assortment. In addition, names of colors is wrong. The actual pencils provide a much different, often much lighter in color, than both the name and the core of the pencil indicates. They don't blend as the higher quality pencils do either. I am very disappointed in this product and will not be buying any other products. If you want good quality, try Prismacolor and or Raffine. Give these a pass!"
1399201,B001DKMZ3G,4,These aren't the best for blending but there are tons of colors to choose from and they last quite a while. For the price it's definitely worth it. If you're considering coloring as a hobby for leisurely time I would definitely recommend these. These aren't the best for blending but there are tons of colors to ...
1399202,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Quality color pencils for a great price.  They work well for me as I have taken up adult coloring books with intricate patterns, and the color shows very well. Wonderful!"
1399203,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These Colored pencils are top of the line quality. They are always as bright after sharpening, as the very first time. They have a thin marking which helps tremendously when coloring detailed images. Best Colored Pencils Ever!"

1399209,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great for coloring adult coloring books. Lots of different colors. Five Stars
1399211,B001DKMZ3G,1,The hardest pencils I've ever used! The lead barley colored and the colors were mislabeled example brown was marked red. Not good
1399212,B001DKMZ3G,5,I love these pencils. They provide a soft tone of colors and easy to blend.  I later chose to get the 120 count which comes with additional pencils and about 6 or 7 new colors.  I could not be happier.  I recommend this product to anyone. Love the Pencils
1399213,B001DKMZ3G,5,These are colored pencils that produced bright colors. great

1399219,B001DKMZ3G,5,Because they are soft. Good
1399220,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I'm surprised at all the 5 star reviews for these pencils.  Yes there are 50 pencils, but there might as well be 20 because many of the colors barely differentiate from the others.  To get any vibrancy at all, you have to press very hard and even then it only works with a couple of the blues.  I would not recommend these unless buying for children.  Not for adults. Easter egg colors... no vibrancy"
1399221,B001DKMZ3G,5,gift Five Stars
1399222,B001DKMZ3G,1,"These pencils suck.  The color is not vibrant no matter how hard you push down on the pencil. Not to happy with this purchase.  If you are looking for something cheap for children to play with because they break them, then these are for you. But it you want colors that make your work look beautiful and vibrant, well I would recommend steering clear of these. Just not satisfied."
1399223,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great quality I personally prefer gel or marker to the pencils Five Stars
1399224,B001DKMZ3G,5,My daughter is an artist and she has tried several different brands of colored pencils but she says she likes these the best! Five stars! Happy artist..

1399226,B001DKMZ3G,4,good variety of colors Four Stars
1399228,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Generally very good.  I've just started using pencils, so understand that when you read this.  I have been unable to build up or blend colors - maybe that is just the nature of what these are.  Also, and this doesn't seem unusual with nearly all coloring instruments, the outer color on the pencil can be deceptive.  There is a real affinity for shades of green in this set.  I am yet to find a set that does full justice to the brown earth tones. That said, I am happy with the results I have been able to achieve, and having the names of the colors on the pencils is a tremendous help as well. Pretty good set for a novice anyway"
1399229,B001DKMZ3G,1,You need to use a lot of effort to have even a semi decent payoff. Don't waste your money. Don't waste your money
1399230,B001DKMZ3G,5,good design and colors well. good assortment of colors for the price. good design and colors well

1399233,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Great color selection. My only complaint is there could be more skin color variations but I just went to Michael's and purchased a couple of the higher end color line for that. I will say that the higher end (Prismacolor) are no better quality than the Sargent Art colored pencils. Highly recommend, at least for the amateur adult coloring book lover like myself. I don't know if they can be used for fancy schmancy art. :) Love"

1399236,B001DKMZ3G,4,There is a nice range of colors. I find I have to press pretty hard to let vibrance from them. So far none have broken as I sharpen them and the wood seems quality. There is a nice range of colors

1399268,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I really do like these pencils.  They are easy to work with and the set has a very nice choice of colors.  I think that there are so manyBlues and Greens that the selection of Pinks, Reds, Purples, Yellows and Oranges is really lacking!  Personally, I found that a couple of the Yellow choices are so light that they barely show up. Good Set but Would Like Colors More Evenly Divided"

1399296,B001DKMZ3G,1,The worst colored pencils that I ever bought. A total rip off for the money. I will never buy any Sargent Art product again. These pencils are grainy on your art work. They break easily and smear at times. They are hard to sharpen and are not smooth on art work. Do not waste your hard earned money on these colored pencils like I did. BUYER BEWARE !!!!!These pencils are a JOKE. Worst colored pencils I ever bought. Buyer Beware !!!!

1399302,B001DKMZ3G,5,The colored pencils worked well on wood.  The group enjoyed coloring in areas on their wood burning projects.  Different colors of pencils in this set are marvelous and we used different colors in our wood projects.  Colors didn't bleed when the wood pieces got wet and the spray sealed the colors in the wood.  We look forward creating our masterpiece in our spare time. Colored Pencils for Wood Burning Projects

1399306,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Good sturdy coloring pencils, I haven't had any problems yet, they even survived my younger sister who is sometimes rough on art supplies. Good and sturdy"
1399307,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Love these, soft enough to do blending and shading, hold up very well.  They compare great to some more expensive options such as prismacolor.  I own both and the prismacolors are great but for the minimal difference in performance I would buy these and save some money. Great product for the price!"

1399314,B001DKMZ3G,4,Good product only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because some of the colors are not even close to what they say the color is. The gold colored pencil colors completely silver. Other than that I'm happy with this product. Good product only reason I didn't give it 5 stars ...
1399315,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I've used these before with success so I anticipate the same quality with this batch. I knocked off a star for lack of color intensity and selection. But, they're better than the uber-cheapies and more affordable than professional grade. If you like to doddle or use adult coloring books, etc. These will work fine. Given an option, I'd have rated 3.5 stars. Color me above average"

1399343,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I have not used them yet, but I love the colors! Beautiful Colors of Your Life"
1399344,B001DKMZ3G,5,I  live these colored pencils.  They color very well & blend well.  They also sharpen to a good point with a manual hand-held pencil sharpener.  Some of the colors are pretty close to the same especially the greens.  The only real complaint I have is the Gold color looks nothing like gold when you use it.  It's color almost exactly the color of Grey or Silver. Nice Assortment of Colors
1399345,B001DKMZ3G,5,"The assortment of colors is great.  And, the pencils also have vivid colors and sharpen well as some pencils just fall apart when sharpened.
I think it was a great value also.  Tried some other brands less expensive and more expensive and the colors were not as vivid and also the pencils did not sharpen well and so very frustrating.  But, this brand is quite good I have to say out of the few brands I have tried and was very satisfied with this purchase overall. The assortment of colors is great. And"

1399348,B001DKMZ3G,5,Definitely buying the 50ct! Perfect
1399351,B001DKMZ3G,5,"This set of Sargent Colored Pencils is fantastic. The colors are absolutely gorgeous. They are vivid and bright! It is easy to shade with them and make different textures. These colored pencils are easy to sharpen. The pencils are very pigmented so the pencils are lasting longer than cheaper ones I have bought. Like MUCH longer!

I really like the selection of colors that Sargent chose for this set. I recently bought a different set and there were so many shades of blue, but 1 shade of pink. This set has a good rounded selection of all the shades you need!

These colored pencils are fantastic for this crazy new adult coloring hobby that everyone is into! They will last a long time and your pictures will be gorgeous! I was so impressed with my set, I purchased a second set for my mom for Mother's Day! She loves them too! Great color selection and highly pigmented to last longer!"

1399355,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I'm an avid user of colored pencils and I like this set of 50 Sargent Colored Pencils very much. I like to color in adult coloring books that help relieve stress and some of the patterns in adult coloring books are very intricate. Your pencils need to have very sharp tips in order to stay inside the lines when coloring in these types of coloring books, so you have to sharpen the pencils frequently. Thankfully, these colored pencils sharpen easily but the tips don't break easily. Also, the colors are pretty and bright and they're arranged to compliment each other very well. You don't have to press down really hard to get a nice even shade, either. All colored pencils are not equal. I've bought many sets that were more expensive than this set that were basically barely usable for my purposes. I'm impressed with the quality and the shades of these colored pencils and I will definitely purchase them again in the future when I need more.

*I purchased this product at a reduced price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. This is a great quality set of 50 Sargent Colored Pencils. They color nicely, sharpen well & they don't break easily. Impressive"

1399361,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Great for the adult coloring book I gave my wife for a gift.  She loves to color and is so happy the adult books are available now.  She always felt sort of silly coloring a Disney or Nursery Rhyme coloring book.  These pencils hold the tip quite well, color smoothly, grip easily.  She loves them...much better than crayons for her purposes. Great coloring aid!"

1399375,B001DKMZ3G,4,"The product(s) arrived on time, as described by Amazon & manufacturer, it was shipped without issue, arrived within prescribed estimates, the packaging was undamaged, and the product itself was unmolested and made with quality materials.

Although the description, photograph, website presentation, and what arrived are the same-size, shape, color, it didn't live up to my expectations.  I thought the colors would be more vibrant, the difference between same group colors is minimal at best, and even with the articulated drawbacks, they do well in comparison to industry contemporaries (which cost more with only slight, if not a bit more, improvement in performance). A solid product"

1399382,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Not really a fan of these. I normally get the name brand but decided to save a few bucks and go with a good rated one instead. Kind of regret it. The colors aren't vibrant but soft instead. I thought 50 colored pencils would give me variety but i don't see it or maybe im just not happy overall with the choices.
A lot of the time the color is A LOT lighter then the color of pencil when you color with it. Ie. The pencil is dark blue but it comes out much lighter. Im just not a fan. I was expensive vibrant bright colors.
Ill use them. I spent the money and its just to cure bordem but i know for next time.. Pale colors"

1399397,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These are definitely not artist grade but they're great for regular coloring. Better than Crayola IMO. For the amount of pencils and color variations, the price can't be beat. Great set for beginners. They sharpen well with no breakage. They are a little waxy and it is rather hard to blend with these, but not impossible. Overall, happy with the purchase. Great for beginners"

1399400,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Its simple these are the best colored pencils ever owned. I highlight the books I read with colored pencils and bought Crayola's before this pack I thought it was normal every time I sharpened them the point would break off and get stuck in the sharpener. In my opinion, The Sargent Pencils are significantly better. Didn't realize colored pencils were so expensive these days. Guess its because I never had to pay for them as a kid ! Its simple these are the best colored pencils ever owned"

1399417,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Great for beginners. I just started coloring, so can't afford anything fancy. I wouldn't know hot to do fancy anyway! But as I learn, I'm sure I'll want to move up to the better coloring tools. For now though, these are great. They don't break and they are individually named (unlike another pack I got that didn't give a name for the color of the pencil ... weird). Anyway, I'm starting out with these and some gel markers I got from the Dollar Store. The picture I've attached was done with these pencils and the $ Store markers. Great for beginners!"

1399421,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I wanted a large pack of colored pencils so I could have a variety of colors to use in my adult coloring book. So far it has been just what I needed: obviously higher quality than children's colored pencils, but probably not what you are looking for if you are wanting to do a more professional colored pencil piece of art. Perfect for a wide variety of colors to pick from if you are simply wanting to color and be entertained. Good quality for recreational coloring"

1399426,B001DKMZ3G,5,As promised Five Stars
1399427,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I do not like this product. I don't feel they put enough thickness in the pencil and I don't feel there is enough dye in the color. I say this because I'm constantly having to sharpen and have to push down so hard. And I hope this isn't done to make the pencil degenerate faster to cause the consumer have to purchase a renewal quicker. Maybe I got a bad pack, but I have to review on what I received. I will not purchase this product again but another name brand. Not recommended"
1399428,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Here is a great selection of pencils, with a lot of colors.  It would be great for students, adult coloring book fans, or even kids.  Because the price was low, I am more willing to use these pencils for experimentation.  Some of the colors are very similar.  They all come sharpened and stay pretty sharp.  They don't lay down an extremely bright color without a lot of layers. Not as good as the topline Derwent, Prismacolor or Polychromos but a great selection of colors at a good price"

I would have rather had different colors.  There is very little crumbling of the lead unless you have a really fine point then it tends to leave crumbles on the paper.  Otherwise a great alternative to Crayola (good product, just too expensive).  I like the price point and the matching quality!!  I will be purchasing another box again soon (I use them a lot!!)

1399476,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I purchased these to go along with a Game of Thrones coloring book for my husband. The colors are more artsy, adult, and masculine than regular Crayola--and not as expensive as some of the other brands. Still seems to be high quality though. Satisfied with these colored pencils"
1399477,B001DKMZ3G,5,So many colors for a good price! These pencils are better than crayola. When you sharpen they don't fall apart. My 5 yr old granddaughter has had many hours of enjoyment using these pencils. Will definitely purchase again. Hours of coloring fun

I received the Sargent Art 22-7251 Colored Pencils quite quickly. I am no connosieur of colored pencils (AND I don't really know if I'm spelling 'connosieur' correctly...) but I'm mostly happy with the color selection (50 pencils, 48 colors - 2 white & 2 black...). I don't feel that the color of the painted barrels always match the color of the lead inside, which is a bit annoying and makes it more difficult to quickly identify the color you really want, but the colors themselves are quite nice, and seem to go on smoothly. You need to start by doing a sample sheet with a light-to-dark coloring sample and the color name associated with it, because (for instance) what they call ""blue-green"", I call ""ever-so-slightly greenish-blue"". I'm color-picky, and I don't always agree with their color names! And, like anything, it takes a little practice to get a feel for how much pressure to apply, etc., but I like the overall look of the colors on paper.

The ""Gold"" pencil is a bit of a joke. On paper it just looks like a grayish color, with maybe a slight greenish tinge, so don't buy them for the Gold pencil!

Anyway, these are a good value / good selection for the price. I'm not an artist, and I've never used Prismacolour pencils, so I can't compare/contrast the two, or comment on the usability of these for an actual artist, but if you just want to use them for coloring books, or dabble and explore your creative side, these are a great choice for the price! Not an expert, but these seem pretty good to me!"
1399532,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Purchased these to accompany my first-ever adult coloring book. For the price, I have been extremely pleased. They all come pre-sharpened, and there is a fantastic variety of colors that span the spectrum of colors. I was a bit disappointed in their selections in the red-to-orange spectrum. I feel there could have been a few more options...but I only dock this product 1 star for that.

The delivery of color is good; you get darker, thicker lines with more pressure, and lighter, thinner lines with light pressure. This is the way a pencil should be, and these certainly achieve that. I am sure there are nicer colored pencils out there, but if you wanted those you would (a) be willing to pay more and (b) know exactly what you are looking for.

For the average user, like me, these colored pencils are outstanding, and I recommend to everyone who is looking for the best product in this price range. Perfect Blend of Quality for Price!"
1399533,B001DKMZ3G,5,Love these. Use them with my therapy coloring book. Five Stars
1399534,B001DKMZ3G,1,"These are crap. They do not flow well, you have to press hard to get results, OH and NONE of the colors on the outside of the pencil actually match the color that comes out. BOO. Disappointment. BOOOOOO Thumbs down"

The quality isn't as high as Prismacolor, but they are still good quality and great for my adult coloring books - that's another plus. They're much better than the Crayola brand. :) Perfect for adult coloring books"

1399580,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I have a tendency to research things to death before I make a purchase and this was no exception.  I read Google articles on just about every imaginable type of colored pencil covering all price ranges and levels of expertise.
Then I came to the simple realization that I'm an old retired guy just looking to have some fun coloring.  I'm not now, nor have I ever been an artist, so I was pretty sure that I didn't have to spend lots of money to have some simple coloring fun.  All that being said, I decided to purchase the Sargent set of 50 colored pencils, and I'm so glad that I didn't spend a dime more.
The Sargent pencils are great.  They offer a nice variety of colors and most are very bright and vibrant.  Keep in mind that not all colors are meant to be ""vibrant"".  Some are ""harder"" than others making it slightly more difficult to apply the color evenly, but I didn't find this oppressive.  Most colors are cable of blending and do so nicely.
I would definitely recommend buying a set of at least 50 different colors.  You'll be amazed at how even a 50 color variety leaves you wanting more.  Had I realized that, I might have opted for a larger set, which I still might do.
Bottom line, these pencils are an excellent choice and if your needs are as simple as mine I'm sure you will be very satisfied. A Great Choice!"
1399581,B001DKMZ3G,2,"The Pencils them self are good, soft and easy to use.
Now that I used them for some time it was time to sharpen them, as I did , EVERY TIME when I continued to use them the Lead broke off and I had to sharpen again... OVER AND OVER till all I had left was a 2 inch Pencil... It appears the the inside lead is shattered into many different pieces which now makes these pencils unusable... Im pretty upset.....

1399608,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I ordered these to use with one of the very detailed adult swear word coloring books.  Some of the very detailed pages aren't made for pencils, so I'll have to choose another medium when I'm ready to complete those pages.  I've been enjoying using these pencils to color multiple pages while recuperating from a broken ankle that required surgery during the last 2 months.  With a total of 3 months non weight bearing, this has given me something to do in my down time.  I haven't bought or used colored pencils since high school, & I don't have children, so I didn't have any already laying around the house when I needed some.  The pencils come in many different colors, & are vibrant hues.  The box has a divider in between the two rows of pencils, so I sorted them out to keep the colors I prefer all together in the front row.  There were 2 white pencils in the box, which I found to be both odd & useless for my purposes.  I would suggest making a color test page before using, to be certain of the colors.  I would say that these are about the same quality as Crayola.  The only reason I chose this brand, was because it was the largest box of pencils available when I was shopping.  I wanted a multitude of colors...  I would purchase these again should I ever need more.  I also recommend the coloring books, ""I am sick of this (rhymes with hit)"".  It is highly entertaining & oddly relaxing to waste hours of time coloring these pages instead of staring at the wall.  These were shipped promptly & were well packaged.  If you found this review helpful, please vote helpful.  Any questions will be answered to the best of my ability. I recommend these"
1399609,B001DKMZ3G,1,"If i could leave 0 start i would. These are garbage. Hardly any color, you have to press so hard! I got the marco raffine and they are great compared to these and at the same price. These are garbage. Hardly any color"
1399610,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I received these today and was disappointed. They're very dull. If your're looking for something in this price range, Crayola is the better choice. They're more vibrant and the color selection is better. I received these today and was disappointed. They're very dull"
1399611,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I actually attended Art Institute so have some very expensive pencils.  I didn't want to use up the pricier ones so I ordered a set of these for both my daughter and I who love to relax with adult coloring books.  I was really surprised at the quality of these pencils!  They were very similiar to my expensive ones - nice drag, easy blending, and good true colors.  I was really pleased that I got these for such an inexpensive price!  Now we can use these as much as we want as they don't cost a fortune to replace! GREAT PENCILS - CAN'T BELIEVE HOW INEXPENSIVE THEY ARE - THEY FUNCTION LIKE MORE EXPENSIVE ART PENCILS!"
1399612,B001DKMZ3G,5,These pencils are great for adult coloring books. I purchased a box for Christmas for my granddaughter and then my daughter wanted a box for her coloring books. They go on the page smoothly and don't smudge. Vibrant colors. This is the second time I've purchased these!

1399616,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I bought these colored pencils to use with some adult coloring books that couldn't hold up to markers.  These pencils seem to be working well for me, they arrive sharpened.  I did put them into a cigar box so I can sift through them more easily than the box when I am coloring.  I have not had any break and the colors go on evenly.  I found if you want a darker color it is best to go over that area 2-3 times rather than trying to push down and get a dark color without layering.  I use a manual little pencil sharpener with these. Work well for adult coloring books"
1399617,B001DKMZ3G,2,The colors look great until you color with with them. Some are way off and the black..well isn't even black I was pretty bummed. When coloring black is one of the most important  colors to me and I couldn't even  use it properly because it lacked. The colors look great until you color with with them

They are all labeled, they're vibrant, they feel quality, I like the way that they color. I'm quite happy with my purchase. They are so nice! They are all labeled"
1399630,B001DKMZ3G,4,I LOVE this set of color pencils. It has a huge variety of colors. My only issue is that all of the colors are very light. You have to press really hard to get a deeper color. I am still searching for colored pencils with more vibrance. I LOVE this set of color pencils
1399631,B001DKMZ3G,5,Thanks! Five Stars
1399632,B001DKMZ3G,4,I love my color pencils Four Stars

1399637,B001DKMZ3G,5,I love how the colors are bold and blendable. Five Stars
1399638,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great quality and smooth colors. There haven't been any issues. Quality
1399639,B001DKMZ3G,4,"This is billed as a set of 50 colored pencils but you get 48 colors with an extra white and black. In that I hardly ever use black and use white for highlights, I was disappointed. I am using these for adult coloring books. I wanted an inexpensive set of colored pencils I could take with me if I go out. I found that while the colors don't blend well without a blender pencil, the hues, when chosen carefully, can be made to look blended with satisfying results. They are sturdy for adult pencils and will travel well. They are not as smooth as my Prismacolor, Derwent and Inktense studio pencils I use for actual artwork (as opposed to my coloring book ""art therapy""). Overall, I am very happy with the quality at this price and may not have been fair taking off a star for blending problems because I compared them to my studio pencils.
Addendum: I have found some problems with color fastness. I will finish a picture in the evening and have to give it another layer of color the next day. While I am quite aware that it is normal to give a colored pencil piece of art many layers, I usually don't encounter thinking I have finished an area only to have to go over it again with my other pencils. I still like them enough for coloring books that I'm buying a second set as I'm going through them quickly. Actually A Set of 48 Colors"
1399640,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These colored pencils are fabulous! They rarely ever need to be sharpened for some reason - whether that's my style of coloring or what I'm not sure, but I know with previous, cheaper pencils I had to stop to sharpen them all the time. The leads are soft enough to feel good while coloring, but I don't think I've had any really break on me. I can do some minimal blending, especially if I'm sure to color lightly and not push down. But pressing down can create some gorgeous deep colors, as well. I now keep my colored pencils in my room so my children can't get to them! They can have the cheap ones - I'm too afraid they'll lose or break my good ones. The leads are soft enough to feel good while coloring"
1399641,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great Pencils Five Stars
1399642,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Pretty good overall, only really has one actualnred color, stuff looks and sounds red but when u use it its orange Pretty good overall"
1399644,B001DKMZ3G,5,The colored pencils are just what I wanted. Five Stars
1399645,B001DKMZ3G,2,"They are nice pencils, but more than 13 of the 50 colors are varying shades of green; with almost the same amount of blues.  Came with 2 blacks and 2 white pencils.  Would have like greater variety in colors.  Would not buy again. They are nice pencils, but more than 13 of the 50 ..."
1399646,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Disappointed in these pencils.  There isn't much difference in some of the colors.  The navy blue isn't very dark, it's more true blue.  The red looks more burnt orange.  I wasn't hoping for brighter colors mixed with natural and pastels.  There are 10 different shades of green.  I used one, started using another and it looked the same on the page as the first one.  In the picture I used red to color in ""Grace"" and in the middle of the top wings. And that is the navy blue Disappointed in these pencils"
1399647,B001DKMZ3G,5,Good quality pencils! Good pencils!
1399648,B001DKMZ3G,2,"The appearance of colors on the outside is NOT how it comes out on the paper.  All of them are very light besides being inaccurate.  They do not lay well on the paper.  Got these for adult coloring and picking the right shade makes a difference.  I will probably donate these to a kids group because they won't work for me. Pictures included.  Take note of the pencil handling colors so dark that it is hard to tell the color compared to the really light or brighter ones, yet on paper the difference is very minimal. Colors don't match"
1399649,B001DKMZ3G,5,I bought these pencils with an adult coloring book and I use them every single day when I get the chance at work I love them! So happy this item arrived right on time and only problem ...
1399650,B001DKMZ3G,4,"What can I say? I wasn't sure these would transmit the exact color of the pencil to the paper, but they do!  Way better than cray-old-a Out with the old, in with the fancy"
1399651,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I am pleased with the pencils.  I've used them extensively in my adult coloring books hobby and have found them to be a good quality pencil for my needs.  I discovered some colored pencils my architect husband had from several years ago, which were more expensive; yet, I keep reaching for the Sargent pencils because of the variety of colors and the overall feel of them. I am pleased with the pencils"

1399669,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I got these for my mother, who is very into adult coloring books. She doesn't like markers because they bleed through the pages. She does like these pencils, although some of them didn't sharpen properly.

There is a good variety of colors, and the price is fairly competitive. Overall, she's happy with the product. I deducted one star because not all the pencils sharpened into a nice point. Good"

1399681,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I bought these, as an adult, looking for a step up from crayola colored pencils, I was looking for a better quality colored pencil that I could shade better with. The colors offered are similar to crayola but the color quality once you use it isn't the same. They color mostly pastel unless you use much more pressure and then they skip and leave marks so they don't blend or shade well. These would be ok for kids but crayola is much better for the price. These definitely are not professional quality colored pencils used by artists, they are not top quality. For the price of uour looking for basic starter pencils go with crayola. The only smooth easily blended colors were the gold and silver. I also thought the blender pencil was part of the box after seeing the video posted but it isn't so that was a huge disappointment. If your looking for decent colored pencils easy to use and get color stick with crayola Not professional quality colored pencils"
1399682,B001DKMZ3G,1,"Not worth the price, would never buy them again One Star"

1399690,B001DKMZ3G,5,I love them Five Stars
1399691,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I bought these pencils to go with an adult coloring book for an elderly dementia patient (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Geometric-Shapes-Adult-Coloring-Book-Vol-3/dp/1942268254/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Geometric Shapes Adult Coloring Book, Vol. 3</a>). An activities director at an assisted living center suggested pencils rather than crayons. The 50 colors are great, as this patient used to quilt and even now has an eye for design and color. The only thing that doesn't work for us is that the box is a tight fit and the patient doesn't have the dexterity to get the pencils in and out of the box. We've put them in a zip-lock bag and left it open for her. I'm realizing how difficult the world is for elderly people -- packaging is especially daunting. Great set for an artistic elderly person"
1399692,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I work in a Unit of a high school that teaches girls (it's an all girls school) who have learning disabilities.  There is frequent need for colored pencils, but the ones we had were sharpened and used so often that they recently got too small to use.  I purchased this set to take their place.  Personally, I use artist's quality pencils because I'm an artist, but I wasn't going to purchase those because they're softer than these Sargent Colored Pencils and would disappear in no time through use and sharpening.  These Sargent pencils are just the right hardness to last for some time, they are bright and vibrant colors that can be spread easily, and I even found that they could be blended to a certain degree.  The students love working with them because they make doing the lesson more exciting, and they don't break easily at all.  The assortment of colors is excellent and wide.  We also use them to color-code parts of the lesson.  Believe it or not, this set is enough to serve a 37 student unit because they don't all need them at the same time.  I just can't say enough about these pencils except that you won't be disappointed with them and the assortment of colors.  Any child would love to receive them with drawing paper and a good quality eraser. Great Quality Colored Pencils!"
1399693,B001DKMZ3G,5,Love the colors! Beautiful!
1399694,B001DKMZ3G,5,"The pencils work great, are beautiful, and came on time. Five Stars"
1399695,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I wish this set of colored pencils included a sharpener. Also, when I ""color"" with these pencils, none of the colors seem very bright to me. They are all on the verge of being pastel shades of the color unless I press very hard which dulls the pencil so rapidly that I would be constantly sharpening it. Even though there are 50 colored pencils, I couldn't find true red, for example. There are a number of shades around each of the primary colors, but not bright primary shades. There is dark green, sap green, leaf green, aqua green, but not Kelly green. Nice Set of Pencils"
1399696,B001DKMZ3G,4,They are okay for the price. Four Stars
1399697,B001DKMZ3G,4,Don't have to press hard. The pencils give great color. I can go dark or light. And can blend too. Great color pencils at a great price. Great color pencils

1399717,B001DKMZ3G,5,Good quality pencils.  Don't wear down as quickly as some others do.  The pencil colors are harder and last longer.  Excellent choice of colors.  They bland together very well. Good quality pencils
1399718,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I'm using these to decorate my journals and to draw diagrams for my physiology notes. It works great and I definitely recommend it. (However I'm not a serious artist, as far as the colors are concerned I would say there are plenty of variation for basic use.) The only con I would say is that the box design isn't very well and you probably need a pencil case/wrap/organizer for more convenient use. Great Basic Pencils for the Best Price"
1399719,B001DKMZ3G,5,Awesome. I really like using them for my art  projects. Five Stars

1399721,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Pretty good pencils.  They color well and are durable in that they do not break or crumble.  The colors are nice as well.  I have used some better pencils that are softer and leave better color on the page, but they were much more expensive.  These are a good balance of price and use. nice pencils"

1399724,B001DKMZ3G,4,Nice pencils. You can color lightly or press harder and get a deeper color. Though I wish the colors were more vibrant. It is a decent set. I am new to colored pencils. I am going to try a few other brands to see if there's any differences. I don't regret buying these. I do still color with them and they do a nice job. Nice Pencils

1399728,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These pencils are very good .  The colors go down smooth and they don't break easly.  I have used them daily since I received  them.  They also sharpen to a nice point.  Their only problem is it takes a couple of layers to get the darkness you want,  but for the price they are excellent. Very good basic pencils."
1399729,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These pencils color beautifully, sharpen perfectly, and have a pleasant drag across the paper.  My fashionista daughter and I color fashionable paper doll clothing together and the diverse color palette of this set allows creativity beyond the typical color set you'd find in most pencils. Artist approved"

1399732,B001DKMZ3G,5,Wife likes it Five Stars
1399734,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Am disappointed with these colored pencils. Bought an adult coloring book with these pencils for fun and to reduce stress, but ended up with cramps in my hand from how hard I needed to push in order for the color to show up well on the page. Not exactly stress reducing. Some colors are more pigmented than others, but the majority seemed to need too much pressure to be adequately visible. Ouch."
1399735,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I bought these to use on all the adult coloring books my family and friends got me for Christmas. I admit I'm not an artist, so this review should be used accordingly. For the price point, these are exactly what I was looking for. The variety of colors lends itself well to the adult coloring books. I am a pretty ""hard"" user of pencils and I haven't had any issues with these breaking or needing to be sharpened all the time. Enjoy! I am a pretty ""hard"" user of pencils and I haven't had any ..."

1399742,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Very nice set of basic pencils, great for someone just getting interested in adult coloring books. A little hard, so not the best for blending, but still a nice set with a good variety of colors. Nice basic set"
1399743,B001DKMZ3G,5,Works good Awesome
1399744,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Bought a pack of these for myself and my sister - they were perfect for our adult coloring books.
Good choice of colors and at a decent price.  Thx Nice Selection of Colors"
1399745,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These, so far, are the best coloring pencils.  I have bought two more sets OF A DIFFERENT BRAND, not worth the money.
The Sargent pencils sharpen well, and last forever!  Good Buy Best colored pencils"
1399746,B001DKMZ3G,4,Great pencils and lots of colors Four Stars
1399747,B001DKMZ3G,5,"There are 50 Pencils but 48 Colors. They give you 2 black and 2 white. Which I was kind of bummed about at first, because like most people, I only bought them for adult coloring.

But it's a professional set made to get the effect of using coal or chalk to blend without the mess. Most negative complaints are about variety, vibrancy and not having sharp points.

But the box says that their ""Good for illistrating, drawing, and special effect shading."" So it's practical to have more black and white for shadowing. And I can imagine they go fast and you'll need a couple extra.

So if you're just an adult colorer looking for a big variety of bright shades, this product is not made for you. They get the job don't but they just weren't made for that.

If you are a professional sketcher though looking for a less messy way to get the smooth-blending effect of chalk w/o the mess, this is a (pretty revolutionary) fit for you.

They're very good quality, shipped nearly the samr day and over all I'm satisfied with my purchase! Great professional shading tool!"
1399748,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These are not high quality coloured pencils, but they are perfect (and a perfect price) for coloring in coloring books but they are perfect (and a perfect price) for coloring in coloring"
1399749,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These are awesome! I usually use Crayola brand,but they are so expensive. They color smooth and the colors are true to the name. I did receive 2 black and 2 white when I thought the 50 were going to be all different colors but that is fine. It is hard to see the colors in its flat container so I usually have them in a cup when I use them, so I can pick them easily. They do not break and the lead does not fall out when Sharpening. You cant really do much shading with them unless you press down really hard but I just bought them to use with my anatomy coloring book, nothing professional. I believe hard core ""colorists"" will probably be disappointed, but if you just want to bold colors, that color smoothly and do not break all the time these are pretty good. So far the best color pencils Ive own so far, though to be far I have not bought any ""professional"" color pencils. If you  just want to color and relax or your kids need colors for what ever reason they are a really good deal for the price. Color smooth and bold, lead doesn't break or fall out like other brands there are many different shades of color pencils"
1399750,B001DKMZ3G,5,Nice assortment of colors Five Stars
1399751,B001DKMZ3G,2,"These aren't as vivid as I would have hoped, hard to get a dark color from them. Not creamy, rich colors"

1399755,B001DKMZ3G,5,I bought these for my daughter. She is into the adult coloring books. I have seen some colored pencils that are grainy and these are smooth and produce beautiful colors. She is absolutely thrilled with these colored pencils and loves the fact there are 50 different colors in the pack. Excellent colored pencils
1399756,B001DKMZ3G,5,"great assortment of pencils, good quality great assortment of pencils, good quality"
1399757,B001DKMZ3G,2,"colors were very light.  even when I pressed hard to get a more deep color it came out pastel looking.  Will use but will not re-purchase.  I like the deeper colors.

Much prefer Erofa Marco. I like the deeper colors"
1399758,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I bought these because I wanted a larger, broader selection of colored pencils when coloring in my adult coloring books.  This set has double the pencils that my Crayola set has.  I've not had any issue with the leads breaking or crumbling. The colors seem to go on even and smooth. Good set"
1399759,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Good product. Unfortunately I found the same 24 pack for half the price at WalMart ($4.99). Overall, it does color well and move smoothly. The colors are vibrant. Though, they seem to wear down quickly. I will buy the brand again."
1399760,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I already have colored pencils, but there are so many colors to choose from. I use them to color in my stamped image for card making, then use mineral spirits to blend. Beautiful!! Beautiful!!"
1399761,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Sargent's Art 22-7251 Colored pencils, Pack of 50 were well worth the extra money that I paid for them. All the other colored pencils that I have used in the past would constantly break and when I would try to sharpen them the wood would always crack on the pencil. Happy with my purchase"

1399766,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Best for the price.  Lots of greens and blues, wish there were more reds (only one real red) and purples (one light one dark violet) but an excellent set nonetheless. Best for the price"
1399767,B001DKMZ3G,4,Love the shades. I only wish the box would open better to access all colors easily Four Stars
1399768,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I love the color varieties. There are few colors though that don't look like what you'd expect by looking at the pencil. There also isn't a nice true red in my opinion. The leads are fairly hard which isn't bad, it just requires a bit more pressure to lay down a nice smooth color. Which for someone with arthritis or achy hands as myself makes them a bit difficult. I really do wish it was a softer lead because the price is great for the amount of colors/shades you get. I still use them of course but only for smaller areas. That's more of a personal preference thing so they may work great for you if you have healthy joints and hands haha.

So if you don't mind a harder lead than I recommend them. The tips don't tend to break when using them either which is great! So overall, wonderful color variety. Strong sturdy pencils. A beautiful amount of blue and green shades to choose from. That does come in handy when doing a large piece. Full disclosure, I use these for adult coloring books and crafty stuff with my daughter. I'm no artist but my hubby is and he loves these. So we're splitting the difference in stars  My hands think the leads are a bit to hard but wonderful variety of colors"

In fact, I have a mixed bag of Sargent and Prisma and they look the same.  The advantage is that these are less than half for the same number.

1399818,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I don't have much experience with art materials yet, but these are definitely better than something like RoseArt and the like. I'm doing coloring pages as a stepping stone to more involved things later on, and I really like that these can produce a variety of effects. I was able to layer and blend them to make gradations without too much trouble.
 Plenty of pictures and examples already posted so no real point in that. I'm sure the ""serious"" brands like Prismacolor are much better but for the price I wasn't disappointed at all. quite happy with them"

1399831,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I wish I had looked at the reviews about these pencils before buying them. What all of the other 1 star reviews are saying here +++. The leads are hard and break easily in the sharpener. The colors are not all that different, pastels with many of them being almost exactly the same. No bright colors at all. Really quite poor selection for coloring. The leads are hard and break easily in the sharpener"

1399834,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I am an artist. I loathe Crayola products. But at least Crayola gets the colors right.

I wanted something for my 5 year old stepson to start blending with, Sargents crayons are pretty good, so I thought these would be great.

They are not.

Color on pencil does not match color of lead.
Name of color on pencil does not not match lead.
A very strong, really big for his age, 5 year old boy could not color hard enough to get a decent dark color.
A very smart 5 year old made his own color chart, he was so frustrated he couldn't get the right color with the so called right pencil.
They leave a lined unfilled look.

Sure they are strong enough for kids. Bright pretty colors. When your younger child is even using, they learning colors, it should not be a product that will teach them wrong ones. Sargents crayons are pretty good, so I thought these would be great"

1399842,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I have been trying out lots of brands of coloring pencils, and this rates as one of, if not the absolute lowest set on my list.  they are scratchy, dull, and require lots of layers and hard pressure to build up any kind of color on the pages. Even with much work the colors are poor and dull, not sharp and vibrant. I will show a comparison of two photos of these compared with another brand.  Even Crayola Brand pencils are far superior to my hand. Save your money for something better."

1399848,B001DKMZ3G,2,"There are 10 shades of green and even 2 shades of white (who really uses white?) but there is no RED.  There's one that's labeled ""cherry red"", but it's basically identical to ""burnt orange.""  The reddest one is called ""orange red"".  And then there's a ""rose"" which is pink. And that's it.  Very disappointed. Where's the red?"

If you chose your color a appropriately, you can shade nicely. I do advise putting lighter shade down first then darker shade over to completely cover areas where you want heavier coverage but I do this with any colored pencil set I have ever used. Nice range of colors. Find these creamy smooth. Great for the price. Good set of colored pencils"

1399916,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I chose these because the reviews were so good, and they're colored pencils - what could go wrong? They work/color fine, but the color painted on the pencil is not particularly the color that appears on paper. So if you grab a ""red"" looking pencil to color something red, it may not end up being red. This is my main complaint. It's hard to tell what the color is actually going to be.  Also, many of the colors are extremely similar if not the same. You would think they are just different shades, but I think a lot of them are just the same. So 50 different pencils is not really 50 different colors. Guess your color"
1399917,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Good for the price. A LOT of the colors seem to be the same shade, even though you're made to believe you are getting 50 different colors. But for the price, and considering I only had a pack of 12 before, this is perfect. Im not an artist. I just use these for my adult coloring book fetish, and they do the job just fine. Good for the price"

Oh and the ones we already had weren't going to work because the colors he wanted to use had been used up/ lost/ broken already.

1399972,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I bought these to use in a coloring book as well as my own drawings and they didn't really meet my expectations.

 Drawing with these felt like drawing with a piece of plastic instead of lead. The lead is hard and does not flow easily onto the paper, it feels more like it scratches into it. The color is very faint unless you press pretty hard and even then some of the colors wouldn't fill in good. I had to go over the same spots a few times just to get it somewhat colored in.

This did have a nice amount of different colors, I especially loved the amount of earth tone colors to choose from. I was able to draw more realistic scenes with these colors. Didn't meet my expectations"

1399999,B001DKMZ3G,5,These are some good colored pencils for the price and are comparable to some higher priced colored pencils. I used some high priced pencils when I do my artwork and bought these to use when I color in the stress reduction coloring books because I didn't want to use my good ones. I was pleasantly surprised how well they perform. They shade and sharpen really well and when coloring in large areas they apply color smoothly. Great deal on some good colored pencils.
1400000,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Pencils are nice. I wish there was a bit more variety in the colors as there are some greens and oranges that are extremely similar to others but not as many blues and reds, etc. still, a nice pack for a nice price. Good deal with few flaws"

I wanted to find a good set of colored pencils for my 3 and 2 year old. We originally tried a set of Crayola pencils and were so disappointed. The color was great, but the quality was horrible. They constantly broke and once we sharpened them, the colored lead would slip out of the pencil completely. I originally looked to replace them with Prismacolor pencils, but I just couldn't justify the price for preschoolers and toddlers. I still wanted quality and a wide selection of colors, just at a lower price point. My kids love that there are so many colors and so far not a single tip has broken, which is huge since my kids can be pretty rough with their art supplies! I had read on some Prismacolor reviews that its best to stay away from plastic sharpeners and opt for a heavy duty metal sharpener. I think we might get one in an effort to keep these pencils in the best shape possible. They are definitely a great alternative to the high end pencils, especially for younger children.

I bought this pack of colored pencils on two separate occasions, once for my sister and once for myself.  These were purchased specifically to be used in our adult coloring books.  As a set of colored pencils, 50 is a good number of pencils.  It comes in a wide variety of colors also containing and extra white and an extra black.  I am very happy with the way the pencils write, it is very fluid and not scratchy.  The pencils are also very easy to layer with and create more bold colors.  I have had zero breakage with these pencils and they sharpen to a nice point.  There is a great variety of blues, neutrals and especially greens.  I will say I am disappointed with the selection of purple pencils---there are not nearly enough.  Also, the barrels of the pencils don't always reflect the color achieved.  I had to create a sheet of paper with all of the colors for reference purposes.  I would purchase these again but in order to obtain a wider selection of purples especially, I would buy another brand to use in conjunction with this one. Pretty good but not perfect"

1400113,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I decided to give this brand a try, since larger boxes of assorted colored pencils have suddenly been difficult to find ( apparently many of us received coloring books for Christmas !) They color nicely and seem to have strong leads and nice color overall. Decent quality for inexpensive pencils. Only complaint is that the silver and gold pencils are very dull & ugly, rendering them useless; they just look grayish. Nice colors overall"

1400129,B001DKMZ3G,2,"The color of these pencils is not really saturated, you have to really press them against the paper in order to achieve a nice effect.
In addition, many colors are extremely similar, while lacking others.  I do not think there is a real red, for example, the red looks more like orange.  The purples and violets shades do not look nice at all, they are almost neon and have a lot of pink in them.  Some of the blues look ok, but others do not. Not a good option"

1400133,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Some of the colors aren't quite as they appear on the pencil, but overall, they work well. Good assortment of colors"

1400140,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I just got these for my adult coloring books and I do like them but am a little disappointed with the gold and silver. When using the gold the first time I loved the color on the outside of the pencil but when I looked at the point it looked gray. After using it the color was indeed gray, STARKLY differing from the gold it should have been. I do notice that with a few other pencils but not as much as the gold one. Other than that i love the amount of colors and how beautiful they write. Gold pencil a little disappointing"

1400143,B001DKMZ3G,5,My sister in Law got an adult coloring book to build up strength after getting her shoulder replaced.  She was very happy with the quality of these pencils.

1400155,B001DKMZ3G,4,Pretty good! When I bought the 50 pack it was $12 so I definitely think they are worth the price I paid. I have been using them for my coloring books and I really like them. I ordered a nice sharperner so I'm hoping a pointy tip will provide the fine line I'm looking for. If you don't press down hard the colors can look very similar but it's beneficial if you are trying to blend. Pretty good! When I bought the 50 pack it ...

1400158,B001DKMZ3G,5,These pencils are so much nicer than what I was using. They color smoothly and blend nicely. I wish I had ordered the bigger set. Great quality
1400159,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I bought the 50 count set for 9.99 a few months ago.  Now in January 2016 the price for these is nearly $50.00.  This is absolute insanity.  You can get Prismacolors for that much money.  These are average student pencils, nothing fancy, no better than Crayola.  For 9.99 they were passable; for $50.00 is is an outrage.  There are other good less expensive pencils around.  If you want to spend a lot of money, go with Prismacolor.  The Sargeants don't blend as well or go on as smoothly. Unbelievable price gouging!!"
1400160,B001DKMZ3G,5,My daughter bought some of these and I then ordered some. The colors are vibrant and it is a good range of hues. Love them
1400161,B001DKMZ3G,5,These arrived last week and I have used them a few times. So far I'm enjoying them. Love the variety of color. Glad I got these

I would definitely recommend for those individuals looking for an affordable alternative/step up from Crayola. These colored pencils are very nice. There are more natural colors in this box ..."
1400165,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Love this set - great value for the price. You will never need any other pencils - all of the colors of the rainbow and then some are here.

Highly recommend. Great value; all of the colors of the rainbow in one box!"

1400182,B001DKMZ3G,4,"What is there really to say? These are colored pencils! I love how many colors come with it and how they are labelled on the back of the package. The only thing I don't really like about them is that they provide 2 white colored pencils? I personally don't know who uses white pencils, so including 2 in the package seems like a gyp. But other than that, I am very happy with the soft lead and I use them almost every day. Why are there 2 white pencils?"

1400189,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I like these pencils overall, however I feel like some colors were just repeated with different names.  Color variance and vibrance is my biggest complaint. Pencil integrity is great, though. I like these pencils overall"
1400190,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Love these pencils!  The box says the pencils have a ""smooth color lay down"" and I didn't quite get what that meant until I used them. They really do feel smoother when you color with them and that makes for a more even color distribution.  There are plenty of colors to choose from too. Love these pencils"
1400191,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I bought these as a gift, she mentioned that they were professional quality and loved them! she mentioned that they were professional quality and loved them!"
1400192,B001DKMZ3G,4,"If you're looking for a vibrant, bright, colorful rainbow of colored pencils, go back and buy a pack of Crayola. These colored pencils are high quality, but are lacking in a variety of colors such as purple or pink. However, it has a huge selection of greens, browns, and blues, making them great for more natural and realistic art. Also, there are only 48 different colors- there are two blacks and two whites (which isn't a bad thing, really). I'm rating four stars because I'm a bit disappointed in the total variety, but the pencils themselves are great quality. Natural Colors"

1400195,B001DKMZ3G,4,Very nice pencils. Just wish there were more purples. Four Stars
1400196,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I really enjoy these colored pencils. I just recently started getting into adult coloring books as a way of anxiety relief and I bought the Crayola brand of colored pencils first. I felt that they didn't offer as many ""adult"" colors and that they were too bright for what I wanted.

These have a really great range of colors that are more fitting to what I'm coloring and don't come across as kiddish. My only issue I've had with them is that you do need to press a little hard to get the color to fully show. Other than that, these handle really great and maintain a nice, sharp point. If I ever need to buy new ones, I will most likely buy this brand again. Great for Adult Coloring Books"

1400203,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These were highly rated on amazon but sadly i am not super impressed. I used them last night on my adult coloring book and some colors are not as vibrant as others. there are a few that have good color if pressed really hard but for the most part the colors are not very vibrant. Although there are plenty of shades and variety of green colors, there are not as many other shades. the pinks, reds, and purples are lacking in multiple shades and varieties. I will still use these until they are unusable not very vibrant"
1400204,B001DKMZ3G,1,"These colored pencils are of very poor quality. They are waxy and do not transfer color to the paper at all (unless, of course, you'd rather have holes in your picture trying to get the color to transfer). In addition, if I'm expecting 50 colors, I do not expect four of them to be black and white, nor do I expect to get ten thousand greens and only two pinks. The gold is more of a brown (if you can get it to show up at all), and the silver is not at all silvery. They also break very easily and do not sharpen well. Overall, very disappointed in this product. Very poor quality"
1400205,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Yes, I fell victim to the adult coloring book fad. These pencils have me the variety I needed. I look like a fool coloring on a Saturday night instead of going out, but that's a whole other thing. I look like a fool coloring on a Saturday night instead of ..."

1400215,B001DKMZ3G,5,High quality pencils with a extensive color selection! Five Stars
1400216,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I recently discovered adult coloring books and wanted to use colored pencils with my new coloring books. The Sargent Art colored pencils were at the top of the list when I searched on here and they had fairly good reviews plus I liked the price of them. I opted for the box of 50 pencils because overall, they are the best price per pencil versus a smaller box and there is such a good variety of colors to choose from.

I've already used these colored pencils several times and I love them! It's been a really long time since I've used other brands so I can't really compare them but I'm very satisfied. I love the variety of colors and the pencils color so smoothly on paper. I haven't even had any problems with lead breaking at all. The pencils are slightly shorter than a standard #2 pencil and they are the same size in diameter (I actually have a #2 pencil at home so I was able to compare the sizes). I've also sharpened a few of them and they sharpen really well. I use the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prismacolor-Scholar-Colored-Pencil-Sharpener-1774266/dp/B004F9QBGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prismacolor Scholar Colored Pencil Sharpener (1774266)</a>&nbsp;and haven't had any problems at all.

The Sargent Art colored pencils are a wonderful set for anyone who wants to use them for adult coloring books or other coloring projects. I feel the quality is excellent and price is phenomenal for the great variety of colors you get. I will be buying a box for my mom for her birthday since she is interested in the adult coloring books as well. I highly recommend these colored pencils!

Update 1/15/2016 - I want to also mention that the back of the box lists all of the colors and provides a fairly accurate sample of the pencils. The pencils themselves have the color name printed on the side which I love because if I find a particular color I really like I can remember it for next time! I Love These Colored Pencils!"

1400224,B001DKMZ3G,5,What a fantastic set of colored pencils for a great price! I bought another set for over 20 dollars.  This one had more colors and the quality is very nice.  Perfect set for a novice colorer such as myself.  Is that a word? What a fantastic set of colored pencils for a great price
1400225,B001DKMZ3G,5,I was worried about the quality but they are amazing!  I use to be a fan of Crayola but these are a must have! Great quality!
1400226,B001DKMZ3G,2,"These colored pencils are okay, but really not great.
I bought them because they were cheap, and offered a really large variety of colors. Unfortunately, the pencils have a very soft, crayon-like lead, so some of the pencils don't really provide alot of coverage and color.
Three of the pencil ends broke off the first time I used those colors, which was also a disappointment.

If you're looking for something for adult coloring books, I'd recommend spending a few dollars more and ordering something that will last. Not worth the cheap price."
1400227,B001DKMZ3G,1,"Received these as a gift with an adult coloring book. Colors are not vivid on paper. The pencil leads are HARD and they do not color paper well.  You must press really hard to get a good color out of the pencils, which leaves marks and indentations on the paper. Not at all blendable. Terrible colored pencils. Awful! VERY POOR QUALITY. Extremely hard lead. Barely-there colors."

1400232,B001DKMZ3G,5,Wonderful! Five Stars
1400233,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These are decent pencils for what I paid for at my local craft store. The lead is hard which is what I wanted because I wanted a pencil that would stay sharp so I could color in small spaces. These don't blend as easy as Prismacolors or Faber Castells obviously, but I found them pretty easy to blend. As some reviewers mentioned some of the colors are WAY off. The wood of the violet red looks absolutely nothing like the color it actually is. Also, I would have liked to have more purples and yellows and less greens. But I do not regret my purchase. I have attached two photos. The colored picture is one where I used all Sargent pencils except for the orange and aqua swirls. The other are swatches of colors using medium pressure. Decent pencils"

1400239,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I'm really not sure why these have such great reviews. I would not recommend these to adults wanting to color. They may be alright for kids.

The colors are not vibrant in the slightest. Most of the shades look almost alike. The actual colors the pencils output to paper are drastically different than the outside of the pencil would have you believe. For instance, red is almost an orange color, yellow can hardly be seen on paper, gold, for some reason, is grey.

You also have to apply a tremendous amount of pressure to actually color with these. If you don't, the page will still be 90% white, with just the slightest hint of an actual color If you are looking for colored pencils for an adult coloring book - look elsewhere."
1400240,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Only issue is that some of the colors are misnamed. When I think of Cherry Red, I don't think of orange. lol Other than that really nice set of pencils!! lol Other than that really nice set of pencils"

1400258,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I got these to use in adult coloring books.  Unfortunately,  I wasn't impressed.  The colors are very pale,  so everything looks pastel.  In addition, there isn't as much variety in colors as I would have expected in 50 pencils.  For example, there is only one red and it is not a pure red but an orange tinted red.  I will say that the color core seems to be strong.  I have not had any tips break, and they sharpen well.  These are not so bad that I will stop using them, they will just have to be saved for when I actually want a pastel color.  I will need to add more vibrant colors to my collection.  I was hoping that by getting 50 pencils, I would have enough of a color range. Pale, washed out colors"
1400260,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I love these colored pencils! They are better than the regular in-store flat colors, simply because of they selection. I purchased an adult coloring book along with these and I love that the pack includes some metallic colors. They aren't any better quality; they write the same as any  regular pencils, but I would recommend these for anyone who loves to color. I love these colored pencils"

And, (earlier) the reason for 3 instead of 4 stars--I (thought that I) got two white pencils and no red.  (I thought) That must be why they were on sale.

I've updated my review.  At least it didn't have red when I was looking for it.  My husband had looked at the box, used the red because his red pencil was too blunt to use and then he didn't put it back.  He confessed when I told him about my comment.  I've changed my review to 4 stars. Pencil quality good, and I got all the colors (edited)"
1400281,B001DKMZ3G,5,High quality colored pencils Five Stars
1400282,B001DKMZ3G,4,For me for Christmas.  I decided I wanted to start coloring and needed a good set of color pencils. This is a great set for a good price.  So many colors.  I *may* have opened them a little early to sharpen one or two to test them out.  They works as expected.  I can't wait to open them on Christmas morning and start coloring!  I paid retail for this item and this is my honest and unbiased review. I decided I wanted to start coloring and needed a good set of color pencils
1400283,B001DKMZ3G,5,My fianc just got back into art and loves the pencils.......thank you!!!!! Great product!!!!!!!
1400284,B001DKMZ3G,5,They are ok was expecting a better color selection Good starter set
1400285,B001DKMZ3G,5,We bought this for our 10 year old niece for Christmas.  She will love it!  Product of great value and all the colors one needs.  Would recommend this product. She will love it! Product of great value and all the ...
1400286,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I got these for my mom for her new coloring book (per her request).  The greens seem really similar, but otherwise, it's a nice assortment of colors. Good pencils"
1400287,B001DKMZ3G,5,Best set I have used Five Stars
1400288,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Anybody who knows me can vouch for how much I love colored pencils. I need them. I am always looking for a great brand that has good blendability, nice soft pencil work and that work on just about any paper quality. These Sargent Art 24-count Assorted Colored pencils are great for my drawing, doodling and journaling - they don't have a lot of crumbling or residual no matter how much I deepen my color and they are true to the shade of each individual pencil. I also love that there are 24 in the box, which gives me something to work with when I am considering my creative output. I'm not the best artist, but I am a creative person and I need the right tools at the ready. Sargent Art has the right toolbox in this set. Colorific"
1400289,B001DKMZ3G,5,Perfect.  And I have now had to buy more colored pencils for my wife and her coloring fun-time. Perfect. And I have now had to buy more ...
1400290,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I looooove my Sargent Art pencils! I have prismacolors as well, and yet still return to my much loved Sargent's time and again. A great pencil!"
1400291,B001DKMZ3G,5,"They are colored pencils.. and got here quckly,. Five Stars"
1400292,B001DKMZ3G,5,If you are an adult who needs a stress reliever give the adult coloring books a try.  These pencils are perfect for coloring. These pencils are perfect for coloring
1400293,B001DKMZ3G,5,Bought these for my adult daughter. The price was great & the product is very high quality. I would buy these again & I would buy from this company again. The price was great & the product is very high quality
1400294,B001DKMZ3G,5,Absolutely wonderful pencils! I love the large array of shades. They are vivid and color beautifully. You do not have to press down hard to transfer color. Great pencils!
1400296,B001DKMZ3G,2,"The color variations are not really that great and you have to press very hard to get a nice deep, even color. I bought these for the adult coloring books and found the knock off brand to be better. To me these are not worth the price at all. The reason im giving this such a low star is there is no way these are worth triple the price of a generic set. not worth the price"
1400297,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Purchased these via Prime Now at a much better listed price. Even at that price, they were not really great.

Many of the colors look nearly the same shade when next to each other. Pink/red/violet type colors, shades of green, all nearly identical.

I have to press hard to color and even then the hues are very light. Because they seem to be merely a hair difference in shade, they do not work so great for making multi-shades of the same base color. (Greens, blues, etc... All nearly indistinguishable.)

I haven't used them enough to need to sharpen them. They just aren't what I was looking to buy. At the $50 price on the day I wrote this review, my suggestion is walk away. There are pencils that have coloring pencils that actually color in different shades. These are overpriced and not a great bargain at any price.

I am going to donate these ones to the kids. I was looking for pastels and brights, this is all pastels, and pale ones at that. Not worth the bother."
1400298,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Horrible quality, from the first sharpening almost every pencil's core is broken in multiple places throughout the pencil.  The lead constantly breaks to the point that my seven year old doesn't want to use them anymore because he says he spends more time sharpening than drawing.  I should've just gone with Crayola, I know better now and won't give Sherbet another cent. Waste of money"
1400299,B001DKMZ3G,5,"So many natural and beautiful colors! I bought these as a gift, and I'm excited, They are quality pencils at a great price! Great"
1400300,B001DKMZ3G,2,They don't color well. Seemed like I needed to press hard to get color to paper. Hard to transfer color to paper.

1400304,B001DKMZ3G,1,"Very cheap pencils, the color is poor and most crack when you try to sharpen them.  Crayola way better. Get crayola over these"
1400306,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I did not like these pencils at all. My preference is for a softer lead that makes the colors easily blendable and doesn't leave stroke marks. The colors are also not very ""true"", you'll have to make swatches on a scrap sheet so you know what color these actually are. I did not like these pencils at all"
1400307,B001DKMZ3G,5,awesome Five Stars
1400308,B001DKMZ3G,4,It's ok pencils. I like it. I like it.

1400310,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I love these pencils.  I use them for coloring and I also blend the colors along edges and they work great.

1400318,B001DKMZ3G,5,Perfect! Five Stars
1400319,B001DKMZ3G,2,"The colors don't really go on to paper as well as I'd like, not sure if it's just the quality of the color pigments, etc, but I don't recommend this product.  I was using it to color adult coloring books.  Prefer crayons with higher pigmentation.  Also, the box itself is not great.  Now I wish I bought something in a more box-style for easier storage and usage.  It's not easy to view all the colors at once (two rows in the box), other than dumping them out on a table or counter at once, then putting them all back in the box for storage. Alright. Not great pigmentation and not a great storage box."
1400320,B001DKMZ3G,5,"For the price range, these are great pencils. If you are a true artist, they are no prismacolor... but if you are the casual coloring-book type looking for consistent strong colors in a good variety of color, without the high price tag of more ""serious"" art pencils, Sargent Art are a very solid choice. Great for coloring books."

1400324,B001DKMZ3G,2,Not the best colored pencils- I think I would've been better off just going with Crayola. I do love the variety of colors though! Not the best

1400331,B001DKMZ3G,5,Very nice Five Stars
1400332,B001DKMZ3G,4,"This box of 50 Sargent Art Colored Pencils (# 22-7251) is above-average colored pencil product at a decent price. As moods of colors go, the ones here are much more representative of the spectrum, its in-betweens and the neutrals, than the vivid kid-oriented brands like Cra-Z-Art, RoseArt or Crayola. All four of the above lines are physically of good quality, but the makeup of the leads (""color cores"") in the Sargent Art colored pencils is  closer to a real artist colored pencil (or ""stick"") than mass brands aimed at ages three and up. Here are some reasons why this pencil is so good, and why it may not be ideal for younger kids (ages 3 - 8, say):

PROS: -- Round barrels;
-- Accurate colors;
-- Solid wood barrels makes for good sharpening (but always use a handheld sharpener);
-- Pencils come pre-sharpened well, with hard conical points;
-- To get much ""artier,"" more professional colored pencils cost a lot more than this set;
-- Adequate number of neutral and earth tones.

Yet there is a price to pay for pencils that have some of the temperament of adult or semi-pro colored pencils.
CONS: -- Some pencils will have different degrees of ""drag"" because in order to keep chromatic harmony among colors, the amount of clay and pigmentation must vary;
-- Therefore while the Sargents do not break easily, they will require varying degrees of pressure to lay down the same depth of color among colors;
-- They take a bit longer and require more caution to sharpen than brands like Cra-Z-Art, Crayola, RoseArt or Mercur, which makes it all the more important they be sharpened by hand;
-- Like most colored pencils, they don't have their own erasers Works Great for coloring."
1400333,B001DKMZ3G,5,I love these!! The only thing I don't like is that the core is harder than I prefer. The color transfer could be better due to that. But all in all they are still very good pencils with little breakage I love these!

1400344,B001DKMZ3G,1,The colors are not what you'd expect.  They are all very similar and there are no basic colors like a true red.  They are not soft / easy to color with.  Would not recommend. Terrible

I didn't keep them in the box. They were too difficult to get in and out multiple times. I bought a pencil bag to keep them in. Good Pencils"

1400353,B001DKMZ3G,1,This is one of the most lousy color pencils I ever use. Color doesn't even appear on the paper unless I press is really hard. Definitely not as good as some recommendations. Regret buying this even though it's cheap as it's totally useless for any coloring. Definitely not as good as some recommendations

1400383,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I'm a disabled person with major mobility issues so looking for fun things I can do in my chair is a regular thing. I have recently discovered adults coloring books and I love them. I loved anything artistic my whole life and coloring was a favorite pastime as a child. I ordered this set of pencils with high expectations. The adult books have very intricate pictures and you need sharp pencils that don't break off when sharpening or pressing somewhat hard. I'm happy to say they fit that bill completely. What has been so disappointing are the colors themselves. Out of the 48 ""different"" colors there is no basic purple, only a violet, a light violet, and a red violet. Also there are 14 shades of green. That's more than a quarter of my pencils are basically one color. I really expected a higher variety at this price, which was a factor in my disappointment also. I don't mind paying a little higher prices for a quality product but sadly, this isn't. Disappointed doodler..."
1400384,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I work and live with electronics, techology almost every hour of the day, so when I want to ""unplug"" and meditate, smell the roses, take in nature or just take break, I break out my coloring books. As you may remember coloring books have different themes and have several pages that need to be colored, which means to me, lots of different projects housed in one book, not taking up much space and only needing a little bit of time, a flat surface and a box of colors, in this case a box of colored pencils. Taking breaks and coloring has taught me that small number of different colors don't give my projects much depth and satisfaction but a box of 50 seems to have all of the colors of a rainbow as well as all of the shades in between. Do yourself a favor, get a coloring book and a box of these pencils, your life will get a little sweeter if you do. More than enough of different colors for the discriminating coloring book adult"
1400385,B001DKMZ3G,5,I do a lot of art work with color pencils and this is the BEST set I have ever purchased! Absolutely great shades and color range. Colors that outshine a rainbow!
1400386,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I really like the set of pencils.  I wanted to purchase two more sets as Christmas gifts, but Amazon continued to tell me I already purchased this item.  What happens when I need to replace the set?  It kept referring me to other color pencils that were very expensive or of less value.  Is there a way to fix this? Amazon Fix This Please!!!!"

1400391,B001DKMZ3G,4,These are great colored pencils and I had lots of fun coloring with them. I bought some of the adult coloring books which are really popular right now with artists. These pencils colored evenly and flowed across the page smoothly. I'm bad about breaking them but I do that with all brands I try so I don't think this is an issue with the brand. These are definitely suitable for kids or students and work fine for basic art needs. nice

1400424,B001DKMZ3G,2,"The colored pencils doesn't go on as smoothly as Prismacolor or as vibrant, but I still used it. You have to apply more force for some colors and it can be frustrating. The lead is very hard and creates a rough finish.

Next time, I will have to spend more to buy the Prismacolor. Doesn't apply smoothly"
1400425,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I was not happy with them, it was just as if I bought markers from a store, it was like some of the colors were used I was not happy with them"

I find them to be of good quality and I actually like coloring with them. They're not quite as hard as the Verithin but they're not exactly soft either. I really enjoy the variety of colors offered in this pack and I use them along with my other pencils now. I would definitely buy another pack of these. Absolutely would buy again"
1400433,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Good quality pencils at a great price with a large range of colors. However, some of the colors names and appearance are not accurate with the color produced when drawn. I've had to write out the color name using it's designated pencil to keep track of how the color actually appears when used rather than what it looks like on the pencil. Colors Are a Little Off"

1400437,B001DKMZ3G,2,when I start to color with them they very quickly are down to the wood of the pencil I have hardly colored anything at all with them and they are very small already. when I sharpen them the lead falls out of the end Not Good
1400438,B001DKMZ3G,4,Nice assortment of color options. Wanted a smoother feel to them though. Not the exact quality I was looking for but are good for the price Good
1400439,B001DKMZ3G,2,The box came torn apart and pencils were all over. Plus a lot of them came broken. Two Stars

1400450,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Best buy on the market!  Don't spend a penny more.  these sharpen beautifully with little waste, the color selection is good. Delighted with them. Best buy on the market"
1400451,B001DKMZ3G,5,The colors are great; very vibrant and full. They are good quality. There is some breakage when sharpening but no more than with other name brand colored pencils I have used. I would definitely buy them again in the future. Beautiful colors!
1400452,B001DKMZ3G,5,Love the richness of the colors Five Stars
1400453,B001DKMZ3G,2,"The color of these pencils is not very strong, and the variety is a bit lacking.  I have to press down very hard to get a halfway strong looking color.  Most of the colors are dull and only a few are bright, and even then since you can not make the colors stronger by applying pressure they look light.  They're all right for now, but I'll be purchasing some better pencils in the near future. Most of the colors are dull and only a few are bright"
1400454,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great Product Five Stars
1400455,B001DKMZ3G,4,Some colors work better than others.  Would  also like to see a pencil sharpener included.  I had to go buy one.  Overall very pleased. Some colors work better than others

1400462,B001DKMZ3G,1,"This box of pencils must have been dropped from a very tall height.  Every single one has the leads broken at about 1/2 inch intervals.  Impossible to sharpen and use.  If I can put all 50 pencils together, I'll return it.  Don't waste your $$$. Waste of Money"

1400467,B001DKMZ3G,5,Much better than I expected for the price.  I can actually layer them.  They are not a rival to prismacolor but much better than cheep pencils.  Great for my fun coloring projects. Much better than I expected for the price
1400468,B001DKMZ3G,5,Awesome pencils! I love to color but didn't want to use my son's art supplies any more. This is a great set for adults. Lots of colors! Love them!

1400470,B001DKMZ3G,4,Perfect Four Stars
1400472,B001DKMZ3G,2,The colors are comically inaccurate. Or it would be comical if it wasn't so irritating. Why in the world would Gold look like Gray?
1400473,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I have to say, I do not understand where all the good reviews are coming from.  The pencils are very hard and you have to press so firmly to lay down the color that the pages are very indented.  Also, the Cherry Red looks exactly like the burnt orange and so on, and so on... basically every orange and red, or reddish, pencil looks exactly alike on the paper.  I carefully sharpened on to make sure it was not a point coating or something.  It is not.  I am going to return them even though they were not very expensive.  I just hate being sold inferior products that do not live up to the presented expectations.  It will be worth the extra cash to go to the art supply store and pay the price of something I can actually enjoy using
Amazon I want a refund ! Do not waste your money."

1400525,B001DKMZ3G,2,"50 colors but many so close that it's hard to tell the difference. If you're a real artist and care about that level of subtlety you'll buy way better pencils. I'm just playing with them and expected more colors! Would have liked a true red, hot pink, royal blue. Way too many greens, so I guess if you're drawing trees you'll be happy. Hardly any purples and none of them are very purple. The pinks are pretty lame and mostly too orange. The pale oranges and yellows are useless. Inconsistent texture - most are too hard, only a few go on smooth. To get any color intensity you really have to lean into it. If you're a real artist and care about that level of subtlety you'll buy way better pencils. I'm just playing with them and expe"
1400526,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Received Sargent Art 50-count colored pencils in the late afternoon, yesterday. I had been waiting to work on a few things, until I received them & I am so glad I did!
Was impressed immediately by the many shades of green, blue, yellow...the list goes on.
These are not your children's colored pencils, what a difference between the Blue in the yellow/green box & those in the Sargent Art box! **Yes, I am an adult & I color in adult coloring books with ADULT COLORED PENCILS!
The colors are true.
I was able to color without holding the pencil tightly, even when going for a deep rich shading!
Was able to blend colors into each other, without blending pencils (never knew one should have these - had never heard of them before either).
Time to color now, I really need to get back to color now....think I may need a support group start! Not your Green & Yellow Box Colored Pencils!"
1400527,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Disappointing - lovely colours but pencils break regularly, which is very annoying. Leads not very strong"

These pencils are not extremely soft or hard like the old time but just right. They allow you to use them and getting a good color rendition without the tips breaking constantly. I bough them for my wife for drawing in color, but I love them; now she don't let me use them (because they are hers!) She is always possessive of the good things in life. Now she won't share!"

1400549,B001DKMZ3G,4,These pencils are smooth and shade easily. With a wide variety of colors they are perfect with to go with the stress relief book craze. Not 5 star because I guess in packaging it was a bit rough and a couple of pencils led broke and won't hold anymore. Perfect shading

1400551,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Let me start off by saying Amazon has great customer service. I got this and a box of colored pencils and they came in with half of the pencil tips broken and the book bent from the packaging. I was disappointed so I contacted them and by the next day they had new product on its way to me. They were very nice about it as well. As for the product itself, I would highly recommend.

Freshly sharpened of course colors much better than ones that have been used for a bit for these so I sharpen often, but they do a very good job of holding a point without crumbling. Not bad"

1400568,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Great set of colored pencils. I got these because I recently found ""adult coloring books"" and I didn't want to use crayons because they are not precise enough for my liking. These are better than the colored pencils that I snatched from my kid's room. The color pay off is better and these don't seem as waxy. I have been using them for a couple weeks now and have not had to sharpen any of them yet. Great set of colored pencils"
1400569,B001DKMZ3G,1,"Don't even... Try to find a better brand cause this is one is pure garbage; first of all, the colors don't correspond to the color of the pencil (believe it or not). There isn't, for example, a red pencil. The shade of red is more of a light brown or orange, but no bright red. Second of all, you waste almost half of the pencil if you try to sharpen it.
It was pure waste of money and now I'll have to find better ones. Try to find a better brand cause this is one is pure garbage"

1400599,B001DKMZ3G,2,"As many other folks have said, a lot of these colors are similar. Even if you press really hard when coloring, it's sometimes hard to differentiate between some of the colors. I don't think I would buy this brand again. so-so"

1400603,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I got them for my new coloring book (trying to de-stress). Knowing that these pencils are not expensive, I kept my expectations low but they are so waxy and even though there are 50 pencils, many of the colors are so similar. Also, it takes a lot of hard coloring to get the colors onto the paper. For the lighter shades, they barely showed up on the paper. Colors not vibrant, don't go on paper easily"

Turns out I was too spoiled on my Prisma's, because these aren't incredibly pigmented, and I didn't end up using them much whatsoever for art.
Even so, I use them for taking notes in class. They're pretty good pencils"

1400611,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Great selection of colors. Nice quality for the price. They're definitely not as nice as my prisma color set, but they're so much cheaper that it makes up for the difference. Another thing that these are missing over my prisma color set is that the box doesn't allow you to see what's in the back row without taking them out.

If you're serious about your artwork, spring the extra for the prisma colors. It's a very noticeable difference in how smooth they go on and how well they cover.

If you're just a novice like me, these Sargent colored pencils are just fine. Nice for the price for novice artists"

1400647,B001DKMZ3G,5,Excellent pencils. Five Stars
1400648,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I like these pencils fine.  They seem to wear down very easily, and even though there are 50 pencils in the box, there are so many that look the same color but with a different name.  So to me there wasn't as much of a choice in colors in this package.  But they are okay. Okay"
1400649,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Bought these for my wife who likes to relieve stress by coloring.  Good selection of colors, good coverage,,not too soft and not too hard.  Has been using for several weeks and just of few of colors used frequently need to be sharpened.  These are the first colored pencils we have ordered, and will probably reorder same ones again when needed. No Issues, Great Pencils For What We Use Them For"

1400664,B001DKMZ3G,4,Seller sent promptly and arrived in good order.  Some pencils are a bit scratchy and not as soft pointed as I would like but the colors are good. Many colors to choose from
1400665,B001DKMZ3G,1,"There is not much variety in these ""50"" pencils.  The color on the barrels of the pencils are darker than the color of the pencils on paper.  There are too many green pencils but the shades are the same.  There are two white pencils and two black pencils.  The gold looks brown.  The silver looks dark gray.  Really bad.  This might as well be a set of 10 color pencils. don't buy!"
1400666,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These colored pencils are pretty nice. The pencils don't break and arrived in erfect condition. I think having a quality sharpener makes a difference.  I also have the Prismacolor box of 24, which I like better. But there are some colors in this box that are not in the other brand. Some of them seem to not apply to the paper well, as it seems the lead is too hard. It is mostly the light colors that this happens with. It was still worth having though. I think there are too many brown colors and not enough of the red/pink colors. The Aqua-green is a beautiful color, and the deep blue. Again, there are a lot of blue colors, but some do not apply well, but I would still get it again. It is less expensive than Prismacolor, per pencil. With both I have almost every color I would like. These colored pencils are pretty nice. The pencils don't break and arrived in ..."

1400670,B001DKMZ3G,2,They came with multiple pencils of the exact same color. I'm pissed. Two Stars
1400671,B001DKMZ3G,2,"For people like me who were looking for a decent set of colored pencils for an affordable price I would suggest not buying these. As an artist I was hoping for a set of vibrant colors with a smooth texture. This set doesn't even contain the main colors that usually appear in any other pencil sets such as Crayola. That being said, the main issue I have with this set is that the colors don't even sink in the page. The texture is ruff and takes a lot of effort to really get the color to grasp vibrantly into the page. This set may be good for someone who just wants to mindlessly color in something without expectations of professional vibrant colors. I wouldn't yet consider myself to be a professional artist, however the quality of materials for my artistic needs are set for higher standards than this. Anyway as an honest opinion I would like to suggest that if anyone is looking for a good set of professional high quality vibrant colored pencils to save up some cash and buy a set of PrismColor pencils.(They're worth it in my  opinion). Check out the picture I drew using mostly crayola colored pencils since Sargent Art miserably failed at providing its main purpose. The only color used from Sargent Art was on Crash Bandicoot's tan colored stomach.(Vibrancy was induced using photoshop...so results may vary) Colored Pencils With No Color!? WTF"

1400679,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I'm not an artist, just an avid colorer. I was looking for something a little better quality and with more colors than your standard crayola pencil. I read several reviews saying these were fine for the novice user, and that's definitely the case. I was surprised at how much smoother these are than regular colored pencils. For me, these are ""high quality"" - and great color choices! Step up for this basic pencil user!"
1400681,B001DKMZ3G,2,"The reason for my low starred review is because,  while this a 50 pack of colored pencils, 9 of the pencils are a variety of green and there is only 1 shade of red. It's called ""cherry red"", and it's actually orange. A lot of the purples and pinks barely have a color difference, if any variation at all. I purchased this with the hopes of avoiding the costly, yet obviously better quality pencils, but seems like it just isn't worth it for the price. Would return if I could. lack of  color variety!"

1400685,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I received these as a gift and am so disappointed with the quality of these pencils.  I tried using them for an adult coloring book.  The colors all look the same (ex. all the purples look the same as each other, all the reds look the same) except for a few colors that look startlingly different than how expected.  You have to press very hard to get color onto your paper.  I'm looking into sending these back. Poor quality"
1400686,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Great color selection and color output, although I'm not a fan of the silver and gold pencils. Whatever is added to make them metallic makes the lead super soft and it's not enjoyable to color with, nor are they terrible metallic looking on paper. Great Pencils"

1400701,B001DKMZ3G,4,This is a nice box of pencils.  I am not fond of some of the lighter yellows as I am not able to see the color enough. They might be better on different paper but in my color book it does not show up well.  The pencil colors in general seem to be made of softer material then my Staedler set of pencils.  I like both sets and intermingle both boxes when I color. This is a nice box of pencils

1400709,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Pencils are assumed to be OK - they were a gift for someone else. However, the packaging was not very good. The flimsy package opened up in shipment and the pencils spilled out. It should have been secured better; perhaps a little tape would have kept it all together. Pencils good, package not so good."

1400719,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Hard to produce colors, and as some of the other reviews mentioned... though it looks like you have 50 colors... most of the colors in the same family look pretty much identical to each other once on paper, it's like you have only have 12 colors. Additionally, because of how hard the lead is, it is very difficult to built up, and impossible to blend with other colors. Rookie mistake! though it looks like you have 50 colors"
1400720,B001DKMZ3G,5,Bought as a gift for my nephew. Five Stars
1400721,B001DKMZ3G,2,"The colors are not bright.  Within each group of colors,  the barrels are different but they turn out the same on paper.  Pinks and purples are pretty much the same,  as are the blues and greens.  Disappointing. Pinks and purples are pretty much the same"
1400722,B001DKMZ3G,5,Really nice colored pencils and every color! Five Stars
1400723,B001DKMZ3G,2,I bought these to use with a coloring book. The color doesn't go on well and the amount of pressure needed to get the color makes using them not very fun. Didn't work for what I needed them for
1400724,B001DKMZ3G,4,Good quality Four Stars
1400725,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Great selection of colors.  Nice quality for the price.  They're definitely not as nice as my prisma color set, but they're so much cheaper that it makes up for the difference.  Another thing that these are missing over my prisma color set is that the box doesn't allow you to see what's in the back row without taking them out.

If you're serious about your artwork, spring the extra for the prisma colors.  It's a very noticeable difference in how smooth they go on and how well they cover.

If you're just a novice like me, these Sargent colored pencils are just fine. Nice for the price for novice artists"

Not impressed. Box also came torn up. Not impressed"
1400728,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Poorly made.  Several pencils have fractured ""lead"", which means you must sharpen them over and over again before finding a tip that isn't already loose.  The colors are bright and easy to blend/shade with, but that doesn't matter when the tips won't stop breaking. The colors are bright and easy to blend/shade with"

1400791,B001DKMZ3G,5,"50 colored pencils, very high quality.  There are two black pencils (good!) and two white (meh), but most other colors do not repeat.  One color I wished they had was dark grey!  There is a silvery color, several green shades, many blue shades, and a lot of browns and yellows.  The shades are somber, more earth or nature tones.  I use them for coloring maps and such for table top RPG games and for fun and simple drawings.  These aren't the top quality, but they are slightly better than Crayola (which are surprisingly good quality - though very bright colored) and MUCH better than Rose Art.  They aren't PRISMACOLOR by any stretch, but they suffice for fun, non-professional art. Very little issues with broken lead falling out of the cylinder (looking at you Rose Art!). Ridiculous value!"

In fact, ordering another set now so I have a spare set on hand. I really like these pencils"
1400799,B001DKMZ3G,4,These are a firm lead pencil.  They do not give deep color unless you go over an area several time.  I use them for gentle shading or when I want a true pastel in my work. Gentle shades

1400811,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I got these colored pencils mainly for the price.  I should have ordered the more premium brand.  These pencils did not lay down thick, consistent color.  Furthermore, the color was often drastically different on paper from the pencil casing or as the name of the pencil suggested.  Many of the colors - especially in the pink and violet hues- appeared to be the exact same color. If you're looking for a high quality, consistent color lay down, you will want to choose another brand. Non-consistent color laydown"
1400812,B001DKMZ3G,5,Wanted something my kids who are just starting to scribble could use. These are simple colour pencils. A variety of colours. Colours are vibrant and nice. Just what I needed a nice set!

1400814,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Sargent is an excellent product generally. When I need art supplies, I always try to buy Sargent because I can always depend on high quality products. Also, Sargent is not one of the very expensive supplies that are out there. I would recommend Sargent to all who need  artist supplies. Sargent is the one to buy...great quality supplies and reasonable prices."
1400815,B001DKMZ3G,5,The kids love them. Five Stars
1400816,B001DKMZ3G,5,"They're great, however I like to color in quite dark, and these pencils color very lightly. Otherwise, they're great. great pencils"
1400817,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great product at great price Five Stars
1400818,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I don't see how this product has such great reviews. These pencils are not great at all. The lead is hard, and color will not transfer easily. They leave an indent in the paper, and a shiny glaze, making them almost impossible to mix or shade. And good luck trying to get any part of your project colored in solidly. I am not impressed. My 9 y.o. nephew even remarked at how sucky they are compared to his crayola colored pencils. I just used his while we colored. If i could 0 star i would. Not a quality product"
1400819,B001DKMZ3G,5,What a great deal and a huge color selection. My son loves these and asked me to give it 5 stars. What a great deal and a huge color selection
1400820,B001DKMZ3G,5,"good price, good shipping, nice variety pencils"
1400821,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I am no artist, nor colored pencil guru, but I will say the quality of these are fantastic compared to many other brands.  My kids are into arts and crafts and drawing - they're very artistic.  I've bought Crayola and they asked for better/higher-quality pencils.  These offer what they want apparently and the color variety is perfect.  I'm getting lots of art to hang all over my house now - the best kind that can't be bought.  It's probably not a very helpful review...but the pencils seem to be lasting them way better than other brands and giving them richer colors. Color the sky"
1400822,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I have found that Sargent Art colored pencils are the best I've used so far. Even an artist friend of mine liked them better than any other she has used. The colors are vibrant and can be blended with other colors easily. The wood casing in these pencils is hard and doesn't break easily. They sharpen well and very rarely do the leads break off when I am sharpening them. I love the assortment in this 50 count pack. The only color it doesn't have is a good nude that actually looks like skin and not a pale lemon, but I did manage to create my own by experimenting with several shades of other colors. Wonderful colored pencils"
1400823,B001DKMZ3G,4,Colors are kind of faint. Would like it if there were darker colors Would like it if there were darker

1400828,B001DKMZ3G,5,"This set has a good range of colors, as well as being a good amount of colored pencils for the price. I generally use them for art pieces and coloring. While it may not be the absolute best coloring pencils in the world, it was exactly what I was looking for. Quality product at an affordable price. Great for the price!"
1400830,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I bought these for my 4 1:2 year old.  They color awesome.  Other brands, the color didn't produce solid results and it caused my daughter to be frustrated.  These come on solid and sharpen well also.  Very pleased and will buy this product again when needed Awesome colored pencils !"
1400831,B001DKMZ3G,5,"these were a present for someone, but I think she really likes them. and they were a good price as well.
Thank you colored pencils"

1400834,B001DKMZ3G,5,"These are hard core pencils. Great for detail work, shadowing and drawing/sketching. They will blend with each other but not well. Didn't have any problems sharpening them like other mentioned. Good for drawing not so much for coloring"
1400835,B001DKMZ3G,5,Was a birthday gift to a special friend.  He is a wonderful artist.  He loves them and has been using since receiving them on June 9. Beautiful colors.
1400836,B001DKMZ3G,5,"After trying many brands, including the stand-by Crayolas, these are the best colored pencils I've found.  The colors are vibrant and go on smoothly.  They seem to glide over the paper. The Best I've Found"
1400837,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I didn't buy these from Amazon, I bought them at my local Hobby Lobby. I was in my first art class for a couple years and I needed some colored pencils. I didn't want to buy the typical Crayola ones because I wanted some that were professional quality. I was pleasantly surprised when I first used these. These colored pencils glided smoothly across the paper. The colors these pencils gave were rich and vibrant. It was also really easy to change the depth of color. I could go as light, or as dark as I wanted. The lead itself is strong and won't break when pressure is added. Be careful sharpening these things though. You can get a better tip on the lead if you use a hand-sharpener. Great for any artist"
1400838,B001DKMZ3G,5,Sargent Art 22-7251 50-Count Assorted Colored Pencils are great art pencils.  I would buy this product again.  Arrived quickly and in good condition. Sargent Art 22-7251 50-Count Assorted Colored Pencils
1400839,B001DKMZ3G,5,I love these pencils.  They are a cut above the popular brand I buy for the kids.  Colors are different.  More muted.  Suitable for adults. Colored pencils
1400840,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I ordered these for my Dover Coloring Books. I've tried crayons but you need a small tip for a lot of the coloring pages in those books so I needed decent colored pencils. After looking at the good reviews for these I decided to buy them. They were a reasonable price and I wanted something that would blend well with other colors. These are great. There are so many colors to choose from and I'm really happy I picked these. I originally wanted prismacolor but they were way out of my price range. These will definitely work for now.

I wasn't supposed to get these until tomorrow so I was really surprised when they showed up on my doorstep today. I am very impressed. Great colored pencils."
1400841,B001DKMZ3G,5,The different colors are fabulous. I bought these for my wife and she loves them. A very nice range of colors. They are easy to combine with other colors. The Sargent colored pencils
1400842,B001DKMZ3G,4,My children enjoy using these pencils when drawing.  I think they have smooth leads when we have used them on drawing paper. Very Nice Colors
1400843,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I purchased this for donation to an unidentified, orphan girl who had requested something like this for Christmas.  Without having used it myself, it appears to fit her dream well. Charity."
1400844,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great assortment of color. I bought them to create patterns for beading. So I needed something with color range. Quality seems to be good for what I use them for. Nice pencils
1400845,B001DKMZ3G,4,"At the time that I ordered these I could not afford the hundred and something dollars for a nice set of prismacolors so I bought these in the mean time. I have been quite surprized by their quality for the price. They are soft, easy to shade with, and they do not constantly break like any cheap colored pencil. I am pleasantly surprised for the price. Good quality in between crap and Prismacolors"
1400846,B001DKMZ3G,4,The pencils came exactly as described. They were a gift. They work well and were inexpensive. I'd buy them again. Good pencils for cheap
1400848,B001DKMZ3G,5,they stay in the lines and it's kind of better than crayons. glad i bought these pencils. they are worth it love
1400849,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Yes, these blend well, but I expected the same approx colors as Crayola. There's NO flesh tones, and with 9 (NINE!) out of 50 pencils being green, obviously there's not room for much else. I'm VERY disappointed !!! Deceitful Color Variety"
1400850,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Good quality pencils, great veriety of colors, but what I like the most that they color name on them, so you don't need to break your head describing the color to your kid Good pencils"
1400851,B001DKMZ3G,4,They are okay colored pencils but the price i very acceptable. Better pencils cost a lot more so they make good color fill in sets for supplementing your better pencils. Very good for the price
1400852,B001DKMZ3G,2,The color does not adhere to the paper well.  Over and over I have had to do a retouch on a caricature.  Not what I was looking for. Not Enough Color
1400853,B001DKMZ3G,1,"Purchased this because I wanted something nicer than the crayola set I got at target. However, the colors were so bad that I ended up going back to my crayolas.

Shared both sets of pencils with multiple people and everyone preferred the other set. Colors were lackluster"
1400854,B001DKMZ3G,5,"For every1 who loves to color, I'd recommend this set, good quality, A lot of great colors to chose from, better made then crayola brand ( normally I would buy the C brand), but this brand is much better! NIIIIIIIICE!"
1400855,B001DKMZ3G,5,They are great for the beginning artist in your family. a great gift at a greater price. they are what they are intended for. A great assortment of colored pencils
1400856,B001DKMZ3G,5,Awesome product. Priced right! These are my favorite colored pencil brand. I color to help my blood pressure and with my grand kids. They rarely break when sharpening and don't smear. A+++ Seller Great product!
1400857,B001DKMZ3G,2,"There is a nice variety of shades, but the quality just isn't there, even at this price point. They are way too hard and do not color smoothly at all. I bought them to use for intricate ""grown up"" coloring books and will be returning them. Even when pressing hard, the color still comes out too light.

1400858,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Pretty good pencil for the price. Smooth coloring even on cheap paper. Better than the typical K12 school supply pencils, for sure. Great pencil for kids and home projects."
1400859,B001DKMZ3G,5,Great set for my daughters school art class. Good value - she likes them. Good amount of colors in the set. Good value
1400860,B001DKMZ3G,5,"The price for these colored pencils is great.  This is wonderful for beginning artists and young people and kids. They get a wide range of color for a very reasonable price. Large quantity, modest price"
1400861,B001DKMZ3G,5,My daughter was coloring with these and noticed that they are very easy to color with in her opinion...she is all of 6 and a professional in her mind! That is her take and she loves them. Great assortment and the colorin's easy
1400862,B001DKMZ3G,1,"I wanted pencils that were a step above Crayola, however, these pencils were very waxy, and so did not create a smooth finish.  Turns out the Crayola were actually better!  I ended up giving the Sargent pencils away, and ended up splurging on Prismacolor pencils. waxy"
1400863,B001DKMZ3G,2,"Not happy with the quality at all. From now on I'll stick with Prismacolor, and I still like good old Crayola. Stick with Crayola or Prismacolor"
1400864,B001DKMZ3G,5,I love these pencils. They are very smooth and beautiful and work great in my detailed coloring books. I highly recommend these! These are very beautiful pencils
1400865,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Great color choice, only downside is you have to sharpen a bit.  I press down hard, so I have to sharpen more.  Good product for the price. Great product"
1400866,B001DKMZ3G,5,this is a good product and value for my students. I teach 9 to 13 years old private art lessons and I hate asking their parents to buy so many supplies so an inexpensive product  that delivers on quality is a budget saver. for my young students
1400867,B001DKMZ3G,4,We had to buy some new pencils for our daughter cause all the Crayola colored pencils would break so easy after being sharpened. These pencils sharpen easier and don't break. Better than crayola
1400868,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I think there are only 2 colors that are doubled (white and black). All the rest are different colors, including many shades of colors. They are great pencils. I got them for my grand daughter who loves them. lots of colors"
1400870,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I have some colored pencils however I was a little bored with the colors, so I ordered these and there are so many fresh colors that I have more choices to choose from when I do my art that I love it!!! My art gets an up-lift!"
1400871,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I've recently gotten into coloring mandalas & kaleidoscope coloring books. I originally purchased rose art colored pencils and they were terrible - impossible to sharpen and I they really dragged on the page when I colored.  Next, I tried crayola.  They were a little easier to sharpen, but they still left distinct lines when I used them to color. The

I'm so glad I purchased these Sargent Art pencils.  They sharpen easily & I love the way they glide across the page. They put color on the page evenly.
The color selection is great.  There's not just plain primary colors - but more natural in between shades - for grown up coloring :)

For the money, these are the pencils to by. I chucked my crayola pencils in the trash after using these!"
1400872,B001DKMZ3G,5,good pencils for the money and we received them a week early. the kids are using them daily and love them. great value.
1400873,B001DKMZ3G,4,These pencils work well at adding accents to alread drie work... with out having the taky shine that some pencils do. I enjoy using them and have always had confidence with the sargents line of art supplies adding accents
1400874,B001DKMZ3G,2,"I have been using the Crayola pencils, which I have found to be very nice.  I got these on one of those ""sale"" things, and thought it would be great to get another set as the Crayolas are getting a little short due to usage.  These are much harder lead, one has to use a LOT of force to get most of the colors to work.  The colors are very waxy and often ""skip"" so you have a bit of blank space that no color will attach to because the wax took over.  Also, the paler colors (light yellow, yellow, tan, peach) had weird dark marks in them, which I finally realized was actually IN the lead, as my yellow had a blob of blue in it. After I realized it, I was able to sharpen the pencil and get the blue out of it, but not before my drawing was pretty much ruined. (It was as if when they mixed the batter, they didn't dissolve all the parts, like if you get a chunk of flour in your brownie...) Also, there are many, many shades of green, and very few shades of red.  Also, there are 2 white and 2 black pencils, so you don't even get 50 colors, just 48.  And who really needs a white pencil?  Especially if the others are so waxy, you can't draw over a previous color in order to shade....
At least they were on sale. Not great, very waxy, colors badly mixed"
1400875,B001DKMZ3G,4,I haven't been coloring for long and find a selection of 50 to be almost more than I need. These particular pencils are economical and sufficient for the beginner. I am beginning to be bothered by the waxy finish they produce. It leaves a fairly high shine. Also I do not color in the books; I copy the images onto regular printer paper. I'm sure they would look better on the paper in the book. I'm going to try a heavier weight paper for those I particularly like. Good Selection of Colors
1400876,B001DKMZ3G,5,Not a bad product however I have used much better colored pencils the color was a little weak but not bad for the price Pretty good
1400877,B001DKMZ3G,5,I've been drawing for some time now and just realized I was using sub par pencils. These pencils opened up a whole new world of drawing for me. They are definitely worth every penny. I can't imagine going back to any other pencil. I would recommend them to any artist looking to brighten their drawings and make them look more professional. 5 stars absolutely!! artist lovers pencils
1400878,B001DKMZ3G,5,"great pencils, very smooth and great colors. I have crayola pencils and ended up giving those to my kids and I keep these for myself. great product"
1400879,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I purchased these pencils in the hope of doing some sketching again.  I did not use them right away, but when I did I was surprised by the easy glide of the color and the depth of color that the pencils had.  I was very happy with this purchase and I know these pencils will last a long time.  I will refer my artistic friends to these as well. THE PERFECT SKETCH PENCIL"
1400880,B001DKMZ3G,4,"This is exactly what I was looking for,  a variety of different shades of color and no color repeats. . Variety of Colors"

1400884,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I will admit up front that I am not an artist but enjoy drawing.  Every now & then I want something with a bit more color.  These pencils have performed as advertised.  I hope to use them for a long, long time. Wonderful"
1400886,B001DKMZ3G,5,I bought this set for my granddaughter for Christmas and she rates them as the best she has used yet! Excellent colored pencils!

1400888,B001DKMZ3G,4,"These are pretty good for beginners , they blend well and the colors are true. I recommend them and feel they are a good product Sargent art pencils"
1400889,B001DKMZ3G,4,My daughter will have a million combinations  for drawing when she gets these Christmas morning!!  She is gong to have all kinds of great surprises to show me. Very Nice!
1400890,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I ended up with these as a fluke of fate and I love them.  The colors are vibrant, the pencils are easy to work with whether doing shading, fine or bold lines.  I love the colors and the ease of these for any artistic project.  Highly recommend Great assortment"
1400891,B001DKMZ3G,5,These colored pencils are very nice and easy to color with. I could tell they are of a higher quality than the Crayola colored pencils. The color assortment is broad as I especially like the gold and silver colors. Nice Colors

1400894,B001DKMZ3G,5,Really enjoy the colors that come with this set. I bought these as part of the 4-for-3 promotion & am very happy I stumbled upon them. My sons needed colored pencils for school & this product offers them many different options to color with. Very happy! Great price for large assortment
1400895,B001DKMZ3G,4,"Got these to help color code wiring diagrams for a circuits class I'm in. They've worked great thus far and were of much better quality than expecting. Color is a a little fainter than Crayola ones I've had in the past but sharpen well and are definitely the best off brand colored pencil set I've used. Better than Roseart, not as good as Crayola"
1400896,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I have tried every brand of colored pencil from prismacolor to crayola and these are my favorite! They have a great variety of colors, come at a n amazing price, ( I suggest you stock up and do the 4 for 3 promotion). Im an art student and these pencils aren't too soft or hard and blend really well. They also take a long time to wear down so they will last you a while :) they are great quality whether you are a child using a coloring page or a professional artist, then again it's all about personal preference and personally I prefer the Sargent art colored pencil 50 pack :) and recommend them to every artist out there :) My Favorite colored pencills :) !"
1400897,B001DKMZ3G,2,Don't like the colors at all!  No basic sky blue or skin tone either.  Bought these for a christmas coloring book and there isn't even christmas reds or maroons. No christmas red?!!
1400898,B001DKMZ3G,5,These are nice pencils with good color.  Much better than the cheap no name brands.  Would definitely buy these again. Nice Quality.  Good Color.
1400899,B001DKMZ3G,2,"was dissapointed with the colored pencils, not as good of variety of colors,not sure there is even a black.  they may color ok, but i wouldnt buy them again. colored pencils"
1400900,B001DKMZ3G,4,"I wanted to find a good set of colored pencils for my 3 and 2 year old. We originally tried a set of Crayola pencils and were so disappointed. The color was great, but the quality was horrible. They constantly broke and once we sharpened them, the colored lead would slip out of the pencil completely. I originally looked to replace them with Prismacolor pencils, but I just couldn't justify the price for preschoolers and toddlers. I still wanted quality and a wide selection of colors, just at a lower price point. My kids love that there are so many colors and so far not a single tip has broken, which is huge since my kids can be pretty rough with their art supplies! I had read on some Prismacolor reviews that its best to stay away from plastic sharpeners and opt for a heavy duty metal sharpener. I think we might get one in an effort to keep these pencils in the best shape possible. They are definitely a great alternative to the high end pencils, especially for younger children.

UPDATE (November 2011) These pencils have been used nearly everyday by my 4 and 2 year old. They've held up nicely, but they do wear down fairly quickly. I started off sharpening them with a cheap sharpener with mixed results. Some of the colors sharpen easily and quickly, while others (especially the silver and gold) break quite a bit and it's difficult to get a nice sharp point. Until you've used them awhile its hard to tell which colors are going to act up when sharpening, so it becomes trial and error as you sharpen. With that said, I still think the quality and color selection is superior to Crayola. Great set for the younger crowd"
1400902,B001DKMZ3G,5,"I got these for my father, who has Alzheimer's.  Sadly, he would not even take them out of the box, so I thought maybe if he saw me coloring, he'd try.  He didn't, but I enjoyed myself!  These are really nice pencils.  Great colors, and nicely packaged. Nice pencils"

4590254,B001DKMZ3G,5,"Very good bargain.  Have bought it three times!  First time was for me, but then before I used it ended up giving it away as a gift.  So I replaced it, and again, gave it away as a gift, and so finally got another one for ME.  Love it! Great bargain"
