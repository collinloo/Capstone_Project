3658665,B00Y3VO332,5,"This set of 12 shiny neon color liquid ink pens with reversible bullet and chisel tips will write on just about anything!

We have had a blast decorating for a couple of back to school parties and these markers have made it easy. Perfect for writing on white boards, chalk boards, posters, windows, and just about anything else you would like to decorate. My front door and walkway was covered with Welcome Home for me last week.

I like that they will clean up easily and so far we have had them stain anything that didn't wash out.

This is a nice set to have on hand for bright coloring or writing. My crew loves to create banners to hang up and these markers are great for using on them because they dry quickly and the little ones don't end up with marker on them for days!

Promotional or discounted product provided for review. Super Bright and so much fun!"
3658666,B00Y3VO332,5,These are nice chalk markers. they have a nice BOLD colors to them. the easily wipe off of surfices also. the best part I got these for a trial rate thanks Blami Arts. these are great easy to use and last These are nice chalk markers
3658667,B00Y3VO332,5,This assortment of colors wins!  I've purchased different multi-packs of chalk markers before and this assortment wins as my favorite!  Great product to use also on glass.  Very fun for the kids to decorate windows and fun for me to decorate the car for special events. great colors!
3658668,B00Y3VO332,5,Nice set of chalk markers!  Great color selection!  They work well!  Very happy! NICE! :)
3658669,B00Y3VO332,4,"Although, I love the markers, they're GREAT! I love the colors and how vibrant they are. I love the chiseled tip. The one thing that I really don't care for is the cap. It nipped my marker tip. This is the only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars but other than that, I really honestly like them a lot. (see the attached picture)- And that was being careful. I love the markers"
3658670,B00Y3VO332,4,"The colors are vibrant and it was easy and quick to get the ink to flow. The only negative is that the tips are easily damaged. I split one of the chisel tips before I ever used it. Sadly, it's easy to damage the tips when you are recapping the pens even if you are careful as there is a ridge inside the cap. There is a warning on the side of the pens to take care when putting the caps on - heed this warning! Nice pens but tips are delicate"
3658671,B00Y3VO332,5,"We got Blami chalk markers last week and we have tested it. All ten colors are vivid, bright and you can make really eye-catching notes and drawings on many different surfaces. I already used these chalk pens on glass (glasses, mirror and windows), plastic (bags and plastic containers), varnished wood (furniture and floor  my son and I drew small flowers on the floor to surprise my wife and it looked wonderful and she was amazed) and chalkboard contact paper. The chalk paint wipes off easily  for all stated surfaces I used only dry paper towel (my wife was a bit skeptic about the floor but these liquid chalk markers didn't leave any marks).
I recommend these liquid chalk pens to everyone because they are simple to use, chalk ink and colors are great and you get plenty of new ideas while using them. My wife is a teacher and she recommends it especially to other teachers and parents to occupy children with fun and creative activity. Useful and fun chalk markers"
3658672,B00Y3VO332,5,"I bought these chalkmarkers because I wanted to surprise my friends at the party with vibrant, shiny, colorful funny notes on

different objects (plastic, metal, glass, chalkboard). These  markers helped me astonish my friends and made my party

special and unique.  Blami chalkmarkers are simple to use  and  they also wash quite easy. Be sure to test them first on a

small area especially if the surface might be porous. My girlfriend is amazed how efficient and useful they are. Now

she uses them wherever she can. Believe me, it's wonderful to wake up in the morning and find Love you written on the

bathroom mirror.

Dominic colorful funny notes on different objects (plastic"
3658675,B00Y3VO332,5,They work great and the color is vibrant. Would definitely buy again. These work great!
3658676,B00Y3VO332,5,I thought these were great!!  They had clear instructions and worked well.  I would recommend them. Great product
3658677,B00Y3VO332,1,"I would have given these markers a full five stars if they actually erased. Pros: reversible tips, gorgeous matte colors, easy to write with (except the orange doesnt show up over black at all which is the entire point and barely shows up after 3 layers of the ink), plus you get two extra tips which is really nice; however, the only way I could erase these was if I had JUST applied them to the chalkboard within about 60 seconds and wiped them still wet with a wet rag. The magic eraser it comes with as the cure-all to removing this stuff is a joke. Nothing removes the erasable chalk once it is dry. When I used these and they sat on the chalkboard for less than 10 minutes just to the point where they were completely dry, they would not come off completely with the eraser or a wash cloth, dry, wet, soapy, nada. I ended up having to take a Brillo pad to my chalkboard and scrub at it for about 20 minutes to the point where it was tearing up my chalkboard, and theres still a faint discoloration enough you can still read every word it said (photo with personal info thats still legible is digitally marked off). On top of all that, it takes a solid chunk of time to actually prep and prime all these markers, shaking and pressing the tips in like regular paint markers. I get that a higher pigmentation for such amazing color payoff can result in the risk of staining, but taking matte paint pens (not erasable) and calling them chalk (erasable)? Waste of money. My photos are before and after. The colors are brilliant and look amazing, but they're not worth it if they're just going to ruin the chalkboard. Will NOT Erase Completely (Even with Brillo Pad)"
3658679,B00Y3VO332,5,I used this awesome chalk markers to label my spices! They were great. Highly recommend! I used them in kitchen...
3658680,B00Y3VO332,5,Love the color variety & excellent color saturation! Im an avid chalkboarder & approve these pens! Awesome pens!
3658681,B00Y3VO332,1,"Stains chalkboard, if you intend on using it again do not use these Dont buy"
3658682,B00Y3VO332,5,I cant wait to use these in my classroom. A friend told me about them. They arrived in a timely fashion and have awesome color. Great product :)
3658683,B00Y3VO332,5,Was selling my car. All I did was write on the windows and it worked. That do the job
3658684,B00Y3VO332,5,Great service and awesome follow-up with special instructions on how to get the most from my new chalk markers. Great service and helpful info!
3658685,B00Y3VO332,5,"This was my first time using Blami Arts Chalk Markers and I'm very pleased with the result. Over the past several years, I've done lots of chalkboards for friends, weddings and businesses; these markers are some of the best I've used.  Very vivid colors and the adjustable nib is a plus.  Thanks and I will definitely purchase again. Great Chalk Markers!"
3658686,B00Y3VO332,1,"Markers do not work well. The ink is spotty and does not flow, making it difficult to write or draw. I would not buy. Not so great"
3658687,B00Y3VO332,5,Great colors. Work great! Love the markers
3658688,B00Y3VO332,5,"We were looking for some chalk markers for a homemade chalkboard.  These markers are bright and beautiful, exactly as we hoped they would be. Be sure to read the online instructions as the silver and gold are permanent on chalkboards. The instructions also give great tips marker usage on porous vs. non-porous surfaces. Overall, we love these markers. Wonderful Chalk Markers"
3658689,B00Y3VO332,5,Easy to use! Possibilities are endless with these markers! So glad I purchased. Directions on how to use for first time were a very big help! Bright and beautiful
3658690,B00Y3VO332,4,"Drip heavily at first, so, use something else to get them going. I killed them very quickly unfortunately. Four Stars"
3658691,B00Y3VO332,5,These are great! Will be buying them again when I need it! Five Stars
3658692,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these chalk markers. It came with an eraser and the colors are vibrant. I am using them on a hanging chalkboard in my home to change out seasonally and love it! I would recommend these markers to others for sure! Love these chalk markers
3658693,B00Y3VO332,5,"I used these for led signage boards at a bar I work at. They show up really well and the colors pop. Have gotten so many compliments on them. They literally almost write on anything: glass, mirrors, chalkboard, windows etc. Great product!!!! Great use for signage and advertising."
3658694,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these pens and they are a great price for including the labels as well! Great price for labels to be included!
3658695,B00Y3VO332,5,Excelente calidad!!! Los colores muy variados y muy bonitos Recomendado!!
3658696,B00Y3VO332,2,"Some of the colors are dry after 2-3 times using within 1 month, have to buy others. Some of the colors are dry easily"
3658697,B00Y3VO332,4,"Havent used all of the colors yet, but some did not dry evenly and looked splotchy compared to markers Ive used in the past.. i had to use multiple coats. Plus the silver and gold markers are said to be possibly permanent, so obviously I won't use them the same way I would the others which is disappointing. Wouldnt buy again, got distracted by THE DEAL"
3658698,B00Y3VO332,5,I'm a first grade teacher and I've been looking for a chalk substitute to use on the old chalkboard in my classroom.  I'm not able to use actual chalk on this board as the dust will be harmful to the promethean board I have in my room. These markers are a perfect substitute. The colors are so bright and I love the dual tip. These will be perfect for my use and I'm even thinking about making a word work station with them for the kids. I'm not sure about how long they will last (especially with the amount of use they will have) but they are working with no complaint at this point in time. Will definitely be buying again. Excellent chalk substitute for my classroom.
3658699,B00Y3VO332,1,"Very disappointed!  I purchased these to write on a chalkboard and after I made a mistake and tried to erase, it left an awful shadow on my board.  I basically ruined an expensive chalkboard. Very Disappointed!  Does not erase as described."
3658700,B00Y3VO332,5,"Absolutely LOVE these markers! They write super clear and smooth! And if you make a mistake, the handy little eraser sponge that is included in the box wipes everything off perfectly. You'll have to make sure the sponge is rinsed and damp each wipe until all marker is all off, but just dry with a towel afterwards and no mess! The paint will stain your skin so wear gloves if you have to. My project came out way better than I expected and I had fun with it. I would definitely purchase again! 5 stars! Love these!"
3658701,B00Y3VO332,5,Im using these in my classroom. Great colors! Great Product!
3658702,B00Y3VO332,5,Love the color variations and the free tags are a plus! Beautiful colors

3658704,B00Y3VO332,5,These are amazing and I love using them in my Windies to decorate for the holidays. Comes right off super easy Great product
3658705,B00Y3VO332,5,"Just got these for our restaurant chalk board specials - they are fun and easy to use.  One note - you have to 'prime' them by shaking and then depressing the tips on them to get the ink to come out....but, love these! Fantastic!"
3658706,B00Y3VO332,5,I bought the chalk board stickers(same brand) and used them to decorate and label mason jars! These worked SO good. Very pleased with my purchase Work great!
3658707,B00Y3VO332,5,They are great! Very pigmented. Bought them for work. So they will be put to go use. Fantastic colors

3658720,B00Y3VO332,5,"We love these markers, they are used for our daily specials menu!! Great product!!"
3658721,B00Y3VO332,2,These are not good. The glue doesn't work at all. The others took 10-15 hard work to get going and my chalkboard drawings and lists are still choppy and ugly. So disappointed. Disappointing
3658722,B00Y3VO332,5,These are nice chalk markers. they get the job done. Five Stars

3658726,B00Y3VO332,5,Exactly what I was looking for at a fantastic price! I will shop again A+++ This are great!
3658727,B00Y3VO332,1,I had Blami chalk markers before and loved them so when mine ran out I bought this one which is a bigger pack with more colors. They work horrible. I followed instructions to get the ink flowing and it keeps pooling and not writing correctly. Blami knocked it out of the park before and I loved the ones I previously bought 2 years ago but this set is junk. No steady ink flow
3658730,B00Y3VO332,5,Their info and tips about the markers are very helpful! They work really well
3658731,B00Y3VO332,4,"The eraser is just like a Mr. Clean magic eraser, so it would scuff a shiny surface like your car's paint. The markers are nice though, although they are harder to remove than I expected. Basically they're good for glass, and disposable stuff. I wouldn't use them on an actual chalk board. The eraser is just like a Mr"
3658732,B00Y3VO332,5,"Best chalk markers I have come across! Vibrant colors, easy to use!"
3658733,B00Y3VO332,5,The item came as promised and on time. The colors are vibrant and easy to use. The instructions were helpful. I will be ordering more for my other business. The colors are vibrant and easy to use
3658734,B00Y3VO332,5,Works wonderful for my project. Five Stars
3658735,B00Y3VO332,4,Cool colors and they work well. Cool colors they work well.
3658736,B00Y3VO332,5,The product worked great! I bought them for a chalk board I was working on for my wedding. Good product
3658737,B00Y3VO332,5,"I purchased these 4 months ago to replace another set by Blusmart. The Blusmart ones lasted one use and then dried out the second time I wanted to use them. The colors of these markers are pretty vibrant and the markers have not dried out yet. So far they've easily washed off, and I've left the color on for a little over a month on a chalk board. The gold and silver give a warning that they may stain permanently. I have not tried either of those colors and do not know if that's true. Still Working After Months"
3658738,B00Y3VO332,4,"Shipping took longer than expected. Other than that, good product good product"
3658739,B00Y3VO332,5,These markers write like a pen making chalk board designs so much easier. Love them! Five Stars
3658740,B00Y3VO332,5,"Bright and inky, just as described. Though I had to really shake the markers hard to get the ink to the tip. Still, the end result is good. The eraser does its job, and i don't have a hard time erasing (i guess because the blackboard i have is really smooth and glossy). the end result is good. The eraser does its job"
3658741,B00Y3VO332,5,Beautiful colors !!! I loved them Five Stars

3658748,B00Y3VO332,1,They run out very quickly. We've only had them for 1 week and 2 colors are empty! One Star
3658749,B00Y3VO332,2,"Product tends to come out too much, leaky and messy.  Have had other brands that work much better. Leaky/Messy"
3658750,B00Y3VO332,5,"The markers work very well and the company is very informative on how to properly use them.  There are extras included (stickers, extra tips) which is always helpful! The markers work very well and the company is very ..."

3658752,B00Y3VO332,5,I've purchased a few brands of chalk markers for our menu board at work and these by far are the best. They have consistent color and last quite a while. And the price is great for the value you get!  I'll never buy another brand again. Long lasting consistent color. Great price. Perfect Chalk Marker.

3658757,B00Y3VO332,5,"Nice vibrant colors. A bit drippy if you use too much, but easy enough to clean off. Five Stars"
3658758,B00Y3VO332,4,"Ended up getting these for a buy one, get one free.  LOVE THEM!  Most of the colors are really vibrant and stand out very well.  The yellow and orange were a little watery and took some time to get them looking bright.  But they were a great value and would recommend. LOVE THEM! Most of the colors are really vibrant ..."

3658761,B00Y3VO332,5,Awesome! And the silver really is semi-permanent Five Stars
3658762,B00Y3VO332,4,"If there was a way to change out tips on these, they would be perfect. They work great and don't smell. I was able to do a large board with plenty to spare. Easy to use!"
3658763,B00Y3VO332,5,"I used these to trace/outline letters I made for giant 5ft tall posters for a retirement party. The marker ""ink"" comes out like paint and they made everything I used it on look super crisp. LOVED the double sided tips.  They were very useful for the cursive writing on the poster and for having guests write a dedication on the posters for our retirees to take home at the end of the party. So far I have this set of markers for 3 events in the last month. The metallic markers( silver & Gold) are true metallics. They look great against dark colors like black and dark blue. You will be very satisfied with your purchase. Good price great product. The marker ""ink"" comes out like paint and they made everything I used it on ..."
3658764,B00Y3VO332,5,"Great product. Nice, crisp writing and solid colors! Five Stars"
3658765,B00Y3VO332,1,Terrible pens. They leak all over you and the chalk board. Do not buy. Terrible pens
3658766,B00Y3VO332,5,These are awesome! We have been using them since December and they work perfectly. They create bold fun colors and are easy to use on chalk boards or glass. These are awesome! We have been using them since December and ...
3658767,B00Y3VO332,1,This product ruined my chalkboards. It does not come off fully. I do not recommend this product This is a disappointing product

3658769,B00Y3VO332,4,"I love how easy the Brite colors are so pretty and easy to use. Amazing cute lables that come with them, my kids loved. And the eraser works wonders. Only about 2 colors were harder to erase but still came off with eraser. Love these so much. Beautiful colors and easy to use."
3658770,B00Y3VO332,1,"First of all, not all of the markers would write in the solid color it was suppose to. Like the orange was completely clear/ no color. Second of all, none of these markers are erasable or washable what so ever. It completely ruined my chalk boards and stickers I used them all. I would recommend no one to buy these at all! Horrible  Non-Erasable Chalk Markers"
3658771,B00Y3VO332,4,The colors are nicely pigmented and work well with my chalk boards. Four Stars
3658772,B00Y3VO332,5,perfect!! love that you have both chisel & pointed tip to choose from and all you have to do is flip the tip around. better than dry erase!!
3658773,B00Y3VO332,5,"These are the best chalkboard markers we've had yet. Very happy with them. We haven't tried the gold and silver though, as the box says those colors may be permanent. Great chalkboard markers"
3658774,B00Y3VO332,4,"Bright colors, good ink flow, quality nibs. Lids do not snap on well - come off when rolling around in a drawer. If you keep them upright in a pencil holder, theyll be fine. great markers, poor lids"
3658775,B00Y3VO332,5,I love these! Would definitely re-purchase again I think he future.  Just make sure to follow the instructions carefully on what to do before initial usage. Love these! Great Buy!

3658782,B00Y3VO332,1,"The pen leaked and was dried out before it was delivered.  I haven't used the labels yet because I do not have anything to write on them with, so I can't say if they're a good product or not. Pen was dried out."

3658785,B00Y3VO332,4,So far so good. It does seem like it leaves a shadow when wiped off though. THe gold and silver are permanent. The box is pretty clear about that. So far so good. It does seem like it leaves a shadow ...
3658786,B00Y3VO332,4,Worked well. Just wish there were smaller tips that you could interchange for smaller writing. Colors are vibrant Nice!!
3658787,B00Y3VO332,4,Great! Four Stars
3658789,B00Y3VO332,4,We use these once a month for a chalkboard. They are a little hard to get started (the color flowing) but work well once they are started. Since I only use them about once a month I have to restart the color and press the top in every month. They are good quality colors. Good quality

3658797,B00Y3VO332,5,"Love these. The flat tip and chisel tip ends work great for different drawings. Does not wipe off easily. This is a good and bad thing. Good - does not get accidentally smeared. Bad- harder to clean off when changing the picture or list.
I still love them. Very bright and easy to use. Great value for this box set of colors."
3658798,B00Y3VO332,5,Perfect!! I used vinegar and water to wipe them off. I'm so glad I ordered these Five Stars

3658800,B00Y3VO332,4,"I like these markers and the quality, MAKE SURE YOU READ THE FINE PRINT! The gold and silver markers are semi-permanent and I learned the hard way after using them and couldn't wash it off of a brand new chalk board (user error).  Every other marker is washable, just use caution on what you write on with the gold and silver ones! Great quality and the tip is not too thick and not too thin! I like these markers and the quality"

3658804,B00Y3VO332,4,"I like these markers and the array of colors. All of them easily wash off with a Magic Eraser, except for the silver and gold, which tend to leave behind some color and take multiple scrubbings to remove from my signs. I like these markers and the array of colors"

3658806,B00Y3VO332,5,"Love these!!! The straight edge makes them easy to use and easy to write with. Ive used chalk markers before, but these are way more impressive! :) AMAZING!!"

I made my own wedding signs & they looked great! Only problem I had was that a couple of the markers were dry when I got them so I contacted the seller. They rectified the problem immediately. It made me like the product even more, knowing they stand behind their product. I will definitely buy this product again when I need more chalk markers. Love the markers!"

3658847,B00Y3VO332,2,These markers will not come off my chalk board. I wrote on it and the next day tried to wipe it off with a wet rag and I was scrubbing and it would not come off. I tried windex and cleaning spray products and it still won't come off. Im going to have to throw the chalk board away. Super bummed. They looked cute on the chalk board. I just wish it would come off. Wont come off chalk board :(

3658849,B00Y3VO332,5,"Love these! It took a little bit for me to get the ink down to the tips at first - but they go on super smooth and erase easily with water. I also love that you can flip the tips around, to be pointed or chisel. Also comes with a few spares. I'm using them on a very smooth chalk board - not sure how they'd do on a more porous one... Works Great"
3658850,B00Y3VO332,5,these are great for craft project. I loved the price and the quality is amazing. I will repurchase these. these are great for craft project

3658852,B00Y3VO332,5,"These have been so fun. I used these to write holiday greetings on my little chalkboard and my larger one that was easy to clean (with a magic eraser) but also didn't wipe away easy once dry.  Im hoping to try other colors next. Also I have used these with paper, plastic, metal and I have plans for a desktop surface i am painting right now. Thanks for the neat product Super fun, easy to use and the different sizes are versatile"
3658853,B00Y3VO332,5,The color variety was the best I found for the cost! Its my first time using chalk markers but they work great and erase just fine. Great variety!
3658854,B00Y3VO332,5,These are amazing. My wall isn't wxactly smooth and I bought a chalkboard calendar and they wrote so smooth. Just a pain to get the ink to the tips to start off and if they're up longer than 2 hours you gotta scrub to get them off it says warm water I used rubbing alcohol and it take it right off AMAZING WOULD BUY AGAIN
3658855,B00Y3VO332,5,"I love this product. These chalk pens work very well, write smoothly and are very vibrant in color, would purchase again! When you have a special message"
3658856,B00Y3VO332,5,These are super cool. I now use them to leave love messages on the bathroom mirror and play with the kids in the shower on the glass panes. And it comes with extra points if one gets messed up. And it is very easy to wipe out. Win/Win Great to leave messages on glass and stainless steel surfaces.

3658862,B00Y3VO332,4,"We enjoy these, but the only problem was the orange one doesn't work well. It is more like a see through orange . . . no matter how many times you shake it. Bummer. I hope there is another brand that works better. Any suggestions? Sort of love these"
3658863,B00Y3VO332,5,great product.  works well.  granddaughter loved helping me Five Stars
3658864,B00Y3VO332,1,"Pros - Fun to work with, looks great!
Cons - DIsappointing in that it stains the chalkboard. No long-term gains"
3658865,B00Y3VO332,2,"Labels are good quality and pen works well; however, the labels only stick to completely flat surfaces.  Will not adhere to any surface that has a curve or edge, disappointing. Labels are good quality and pen works well"

3658877,B00Y3VO332,5,I love using these to create cute little notes on my chalkboard at work. Makes very cute designs. Try youtube videos if you are just starting to use these
3658878,B00Y3VO332,1,"They don't work. It feels like there's no chalk inside. I've shaken, pressed and held way longer than necessary, and I'm still unable to get enough (or any) chalk out to write something. Very disappointing. I bought these for my nieces to create us chalk art while we went on vacation, and now I missed the return window. Make sue all your pens work right away, so you can return them if defective.

I might have received a defective product, but I'm not paying for another to find out. If the seller opts to replace the defective product, I'll be happy to revise my review. THEY DON'T WORK"
3658879,B00Y3VO332,1,Received these yesterday and two of the four are dried out and don't work. Poor quality
3658880,B00Y3VO332,5,I just keep buying these over and over because my kids love them.  We use it on windows and our glass shower and it keeps my kids entertained for a long time. My kids never get bored.
3658881,B00Y3VO332,4,"Not intended for paint-on chalk board, must be erased quickly or its more permanent. Good colors however, and does the job. Good colors however"

3658884,B00Y3VO332,5,The markers worked well even on my cheap little chalkboard!  I was excited about all of the different colors Blami had to offer. Happy customer
3658885,B00Y3VO332,5,"These chalk markers are AMAZING! The colors are super vibrant! You can use these on chalkboard, white board, and windows/glass! I love that they are water based. They wipe off clean very easily and its nice that they included a sponge and extra tips as well,  especially considering you can flip the tips over for a broad or thin line! They do say right on the packaging that the silver and gold could be permanent on porous surfaces so be careful with those 2. Overall, I will definitely be buying more of these. My kiddos love them! Vibrant, easy clean up!"
3658886,B00Y3VO332,5,These are very vibrant markers and work well. I just received them today so I cannot speak to how long they last. They are more bright than other chalke markers I have used in the past so I am happy its my purchase and would recommend to others. Vibrant
3658887,B00Y3VO332,5,"Easy to understand instructions written throughout. Great quality. Good packaging and super quick delivery Awesome, would buy again"

3658890,B00Y3VO332,5,Note that if you use these on an actual chalk board you will not be able to erase.  We've used them on pottery to label things & can rinse off.  Also used them to decorate small wooden frames for christmas ornaments - although I think I should now spray them with some sort of fixing spray so they last for years. Note that if you use these on an actual chalk ...
3658891,B00Y3VO332,2,"The colors come out nice, but don't last long at all! I'm surprised the ratings are all so good...i suppose a lot of the ratings come when people get the email a few days after purchase. We use them at work for our specials signs, which are big but we really don't write much and most are running out, it's only been a month. A lot of the colors don't show up well at all. You can barely see the red, purple, brown and especially the black haha why would there be a black?? Good color, don't last long at all"
3658892,B00Y3VO332,4,Great quality and beautiful colors but not suitable for little ones as they can create a big mess. Sticking to chalk for now. Great quality and beautiful colors but not suitable for little ...

3658895,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these markers. Very vibrant and easy to use. Make sure you read the instructions the first time you use them so you know how to get the ink to flow to the tip of the marker. Surprisingly the caps keep the air out so your markers don't dry up. Love these markers
3658896,B00Y3VO332,2,The colors are vibrant but it feels like they are only half filled with liquid chalk compared to other brands I have used. Delivery was good but better brands are out there
3658897,B00Y3VO332,5,"I got these to write on a little chalkboard for my daughters first birthday. I appreciate that there were enough colors for me to draw cute little designs on the chalkboard rather than just being boring white. I had no trouble erasing these off the chalkboard even a month later. I did write on a separate chalkboard and forget to erase it for about 6 months and when I tried to erase it, some of the colors had soaked into the chalk surface too deeply to come completely off, but thats my fault for not following directions and no fault of the product. Worked beautifully"
3658898,B00Y3VO332,1,They don't tell you until you open the box and see the warning stickier that some colors won't come off. Permanent color?!
3658899,B00Y3VO332,5,"Awesome markers! Brigth colors, good quality! Love them Five Stars"
3658900,B00Y3VO332,5,They worked great but hard to wash off because we didn't have the correct chalkboard and it gets basically stains on our Blackboard but it definitely has work on our white erase board and has definitely helped with our walking in s They worked great but hard to wash off because we didn't have ...
3658901,B00Y3VO332,1,"Poor performance on surfaces I've used it on. They are also inconsistent with writing, and getting the chisel tips to work for 'wide' writing is an improbability. Definitely not good for chalk paint or dry-erase boards. A total flop as most don't even write. Only use for the two that do work is for writing on glass or mirrors! Poor performance on surfaces I've used it on"

3658906,B00Y3VO332,5,These markers are great! I received a coupon for them and paid less than $10! Very happy with my purchase. A few markers did take a few minutes to fill the tip when using them for the first time. But not a big deal. Very happy with my purchase! They work great with my black magnetic calendar. Excellent markers!
3658907,B00Y3VO332,5,"These work great! Mine came in a different box than shown, its more square, but I like it! I'm using them on a glass dry erase board I got from Ikea. I tried it on it out of desperation as I couldn't find my colored dry erase markers so I decided to break out the chalk markers and they work great! Great value"
3658908,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these so bright compared to other brands I have bought. Can get everything clean with a magic eraser even the metallics. Just amazing Will buy again

3658914,B00Y3VO332,2,"The product warns agains using on porous surfaces but this is ridiculous, the silver & gold are the worst, took me an hour to scrub off of my chalkboard Stains chalkboards"
3658915,B00Y3VO332,5,"Received these quickly. So far they work very well on my chalk labels. I have not had any issues.

Disclaimer: I received a discount. However my review is my own. Like them"
3658916,B00Y3VO332,2,"Colors are very vibrant and pretty, HOWEVER, they are VERY DIFFICULT to remove from my chalk board. It has directions on how to take it off. Even some warnings on some of the colors. (Isn't that nice... ugh), but, i had issues with all colors. Stinks, because, like i said, the colors are beautiful. I still use these markers, just NOT on my chalk boards. VERY DIFFICULT to remove"
3658917,B00Y3VO332,5,These markers are amazing!!! Some of them take a little long to get ready but go on amazing on glass and mirrors. Perfect Mirror Markers!!
3658918,B00Y3VO332,5,Beautiful colors and really easy to work with. I was really surprised how great these were for the price. I love the double-sided tip that creates different effects. Really great value. Great Product for a Great Value
3658919,B00Y3VO332,5,These liquid chalk markers are absolutely amazing. I got it to use with my 4 year old who is very creative. The colors are very vibrant it is beautiful and I love how easily it wipes off. I purchase basic Black chalkboard contact paper to put it up in his Workshop and it works awesome!! A must buy for anyone creative! And all kids!

3658928,B00Y3VO332,5,"Chalk markers are a big hit and there are really many brands out there. I got the chance to use some, but I was disappointed when I realized they don't work like they are described. Many sets include gold and silver color and customers expect them to work the same as other markers. Blami is a company that lets you know that those two colors are distinct and different from other chalk ink pens in a set. They also sent me a nice e-book about the use and some great tips that are good to know when using liquid chalk markers. They also put several warnings on the box and description, so I was well informed about all possible dangers. I'm grateful for their effort and honesty  everything they described, proved to be true. Now I can't wait to use gold and silver for my Halloween party decorations! I appreciate honest and friendly customer service"

3658933,B00Y3VO332,4,Love these markers! This is my second time purchasing some. My only complaint would be that once in a while I have to press the tip in to get some more to come out and large bubble comes out splattering it on the chalkboard. That is a minor thing and wouldn't prevent me from buying again. I do wish there were 2 whites per package! Love these markers
3658934,B00Y3VO332,5,"Stick well to glass and plastic, haven't tried any other surfaces. Chalk pen can be a little. Overall great for price! Overall great for price"
3658935,B00Y3VO332,2,The colors are really opaque which is good but too much ink comes out when I write on my blackboard. It also stains my blackboard even when I erase it right away. I wouldnt recommend these markers if you want to use them for a special occasion. It could ruin what you write by leaking too much. Ehh.
3658936,B00Y3VO332,5,Have used them for several projects. The colors are great too! The colors are great too!
3658937,B00Y3VO332,5,My favorite chalk markers! I use these professionally to make wedding and bridal shower signs. Wish had an all white package and some thinner options though. Will be purchasing again. My Go-to!
3658938,B00Y3VO332,5,I used this on plastic shoe boxes to organize my cabinets. Great fir organization
3658939,B00Y3VO332,5,"I loved this! The product comes with several duplicates of the top page shown plus an additional full size black sheet. Allowing you either to use the same design labels, mix and match, or make your own. Best thing is that they are removable without issue too. It is well worth the buy and would recommend to anyone. **This set also includes an easy to use chalk pen as well. This label and pen set is awesome!!"

3658944,B00Y3VO332,1,"These are terrible. The ink itself is very pretty, however it is in no way erasable and they're very hard to use. I just got a new chalkboard and used the purple marker first. The ink won't erase or come off, even with cleaner! The markers are also very hard to use, the tips break under pressure (it asks to you push down on them to get the ink started and they immediately begin to break) and don't fill with ink. It literally took me 10 minutes to get enough ink to flow to the tip to use it at all, and it didn't have enough ink in the tip to write solidly or smoothly. NOT erasable, hard to use"
3658945,B00Y3VO332,5,"My nieces love these, all the fun of chalk without the messy hands Five Stars"
3658946,B00Y3VO332,1,"Just crap. Whenyou shake them, the paint just sprays out, the main pen I used was gone in a day. Waste of money. Just crap. Whenyou shake them"
3658947,B00Y3VO332,5,I absolutely love these chalk markers! The bright colors are amazing.....and so many to choose from! Definitely going to buy some more products from this company! Can it get any better? I absolutely love these chalk markers
3658948,B00Y3VO332,5,"Ok, these work so well. They wipe off cleanly with a damp rag. The only issue was that the orange is almost invisible and the red is orange. All the other colors are amazing. Great product for a great price"
3658949,B00Y3VO332,2,Buyer beware- these do not wipe off most chalkboard surfaces!!! Two Stars
3658950,B00Y3VO332,5,Blami Arts Chalk Markers are a really good value for a super product. My great grandkids and I recently spent time using these markers to decorate cups and draw some pictures. The beautiful colors of the Blami Chalk Markers made the projects so much more enjoyable. I plan to purchase more for Christmas gifts. Really Good Art Markers.
3658952,B00Y3VO332,5,Perfect!!! I can't believe this type of chalk is invented. It's brilliant to use it on the window glass or sliding glass door. I use this instead of buying a whiteboard. Love the vibrant colors on the window glass. Highly recommended! Perfect!!
3658953,B00Y3VO332,5,"Beautiful set! It comes with very easy and clear instructions and ideas in Blami e-book that they send to you after the purchase. I was preparing wedding signs and this set helped me make everything look stunning. The bride was so amazed when she saw the writings. All four markers write very smooth and make really bold lines, so signs were easily seen even from far. I like it because it's so versatile and useful on so many writing surfaces from glass, sealed chalkboards, plates, plastic and more. Included erasing sponge makes chalk ink easily erasable so I wasn't worried if I had to correct the writings. I really recommend Blami chalk. Beautiful set!"
3658954,B00Y3VO332,1,Does not work on Chalk walls due to the difficulty removing it. I ended up using a magic eraser followed up by household cleansers to somewhat remove it. And the process to get the ink/chalk flowing was long and not kid friendly. Does not work on Chalk walls due to the difficulty ...
3658955,B00Y3VO332,5,Love  it Five Stars
3658956,B00Y3VO332,5,"Although I like 12 Blami markers, their new extended version offers a bargain I just couldn't resist. A pack of 14 chalk markers includes erasing sponge which really removes all chalk ink from our whiteboard. I'm so glad I don't have to use other cleaning products any more. It's all there in one set  ready for you to use it! A perfect colorful set of liquid pens and eraser! Improved and extended version of great Blami chalk pens"
3658957,B00Y3VO332,5,This set is awesome for preparing party decorations. I used it to write menu on black glass board and decorated slate plates with different food descriptions. Guests kept asking me who did all that for me. It's easy to use these chalk markers and all that wide variety of point sizes so anyone can make amazing writings. This set also includes eraser so removing chalk ink is really a piece of cake. I'm impressed! Nice variety of tip sizes
3658959,B00Y3VO332,5,Good colors and quality Good colors
3658960,B00Y3VO332,5,"These chalk markers are bright, opaque, and do not drip.  I use them on a black magnetic calendar, and the colors show up wonderfully.  They are easily removed, as well. Perfect for dark backgrounds"
3658961,B00Y3VO332,5,Love them Five Stars
3658962,B00Y3VO332,5,"These are fantastic chalk markers.  I bought them for a magnetic vinyl calendar I keep on my fridge, but you can use them on glass or other non-porous surfaces, as well.  Just a word of caution -the two metallic ones (Gold and Silver) do not erase easily (requires a bit of elbow grease), even with a damp cloth, so do NOT use them on a regular chalkboard. Awesome with excellent color range"
3658963,B00Y3VO332,5,I love the colour Five Stars
3658964,B00Y3VO332,4,"I use these to draw up the specials board at the restaurant where I work. The colors are smooth and bright, HOWEVER I've noticed that it does not take very long for them to start drawing a little streaky. This wouldn't be too bad if the ink didn't randomly refill too much and then splatter! I really like them when they write well, I just wish it lasted a little longer than they do. I do use them a fair bit, twice a day to draw the lunch and dinner special boards up, so I guess it depends on how often you use them. Bright and nice, but a little short lived"
3658965,B00Y3VO332,4,great except the metallics ones aren't removable.  So frustrating Four Stars
3658966,B00Y3VO332,5,Super bright colors! Love it! Five Stars
3658967,B00Y3VO332,5,nice Five Stars
3658968,B00Y3VO332,1,"I ordered two sets. I love the colors offered and initially loved these! After the first use, every marker tip started to gray making them so difficult to write with and words blurred and there were lots of stay marks. THEN, I erased the markers off not one but THREE chalkboards and every color stained the chalk board. I used warm water, soap, cleaner, anything I could imagine but the stains were set. And the writing was only on there for less than 15 mins. Both sets did this. I am so disappointed because I love hand lettering and wanted to use my chalkboards often for decorations. Stained the chalkboard and the tips frayed after the first use."
3658969,B00Y3VO332,5,party loved these Five Stars
3658970,B00Y3VO332,5,"The product was as described, arrived in good condition and on time. A fine product from a fine company. My wife and I are fighting over the many uses for these items and I probably need to Oder more to have peace and harmony in the house. Great item. Making my wife and I fight ! LOL"
3658971,B00Y3VO332,5,"Requires priming to get them started, but shows up very well on a black dry eraser board. Five Stars"
3658972,B00Y3VO332,5,These work great. How fun! Love them!
3658973,B00Y3VO332,4,Been useful organizing our kitchen. I just hope the pen doesn't leak or get too wet sometimes. My husband though gets the labels washed away when he uses the kitchen (not sure if he's just always getting sweaty palms) but with me it's just fine. Over all satisfied. Been useful organizing our kitchen
3658974,B00Y3VO332,1,"These markers are very watery. When you use them no matter how much you shake them, more water appears and very little color. The only one with a vibrant color is the yellow. Not worth the cost"
3658975,B00Y3VO332,5,I love the colors for these. The tips of the markers stayed crisp and made lettering super easy. My dog chewed one of these and left purple everywhere. It cleaned up easily and the dog was fine too. I will say that I tried to wash this off of a chalk board and it wouldn't come clean. I guess that's a good and a bad thing depending... I love the colors for these
3658976,B00Y3VO332,4,"Would have given 5 stars, but, an insert inside the package says you cannot use the silver and gold on chalk boards because they may be permanent.  I specifically bought these because of their colors and the additional silver and gold markers.  Very bummed, I already have a silver and gold Sharpie!  Probably could have saved money and would have bought a different brand had the package specified the details. The colored markers do write nicely on chalkboards however. The gold and silver are not for chalk boards  :("

3658980,B00Y3VO332,5,"I bought these for my wedding, and they worked great. I will update after I erase the board to let you know if they leave ghosting marks. However, I did have to erase something after a couple of hours and saw no leftover marks. and they worked great. I will update after I erase the board ..."

3658985,B00Y3VO332,2,"These chalk pens were very pigmented, but after being left on two different chalkboards for some time, it's extremely difficult to remove. Even when we can get some of it off, it leaves marks from where it was. Good pens, don't come off easily"
3658986,B00Y3VO332,5,"LOVE these! But make sure you choose the right whiteboards. The easy stick and peel ones do NOT work at all with these type of markers.

I also did chalk pain on 2 of the doors in my home, they also do NOT work on these AT ALL. They are so colorful and Great markers, but on the two examples I have used, the chalk/ink will not come off. LOVE THESE!! But be AWARE of what surfuces you use them on"
3658987,B00Y3VO332,4,I wish it had more larger ones Four Stars
3658988,B00Y3VO332,4,Great chalk markers and the colors are great. One of the best sets I've purchased. Great Buy
3658989,B00Y3VO332,4,"Got these for my Kombucha brewing, they look nice, and pen works well, but I had a little trouble ""erasing"" the chalk so I could rewrite they look nice, and pen works well"
3658990,B00Y3VO332,5,"These labels have been very useful. They tend to stay on the jars even when washed in the dishwasher. I love that there are so many sizes of labels--and lots of them, too. The last labels I bought were all the same size and shape, which was fine, but I like the look of the many different sizes and shapes when they are on my jars and other containers.  Also, some containers are different sizes, too, so it's nice to be able to choose a label that suits the container better. The white marker that came with them actually works pretty well, though it's not easy to write with it because of the tip. Other chalk markers or a silver sharpie marker work a bit better, though don't look quite as cool. I'm very pleased with the labels.

The only negative thing I can say about the labels is the packaging. The come in a reclosable plastic bag with a piece of cardboard that keeps the labels flat and from getting bent up. This is good. The plastic bag is a bit flimsy, though, and rips easily. One would assume with 99 labels, they will last a long time, so the labels will need to be stored securely for at least a few months--in my case, possibly a few years. I wouldn't let this be a reason not to buy them, though. I will probably just slide them into a ziploc bag or an envelope once the plastic package they came in becomes entirely unusable.

I included a few photos to show the different sizes and shapes as well as the difference between the white marker that came with the labels and a silver Sharpie marker. Very Good Labels; Many Sizes"

3658992,B00Y3VO332,5,"Okay, I'm not a kid but I love these markers. What I like most is being able to choose a fine point or regular. Great color choices. Perfect"
3658993,B00Y3VO332,5,"Works great. The instruction are very easy to follow and even tells how to store the white chalk marker.  I used them as soon as I got them
for my 2 tea canisters. Now I just need find more containers that need labels. Chalk one up for these labels"

3658998,B00Y3VO332,4,"Good chalk pens, but the gold and silver will NOT come off. Set aside the gold & silver for permanent use!"
3658999,B00Y3VO332,5,"These work fantastically! I read reviews about how they wouldn't wipe off or left marks after wiping them off. I didn't have that problem! Try using regular chalk on the surface first then wiping it away before using the markers on the surface. When you want to wipe away, it's easier if you use a damp cloth then dry it with a dry cloth. These work fantastically! I read reviews about how they ..."
3659000,B00Y3VO332,5,Writes clearly on my bathroom mirror. The colors haven't faded or wiped off on accident. Easily removed when wiped off on purpose. It does what it says
3659001,B00Y3VO332,5,These write very smooth and are very colorful! you can flip the tip to have round or bevel and they send you 2 replacement tips if you need. Ive only used them once to do a first day of school blackboard but I will also be using them on a large blackboard poster for my son's 1st birthday! They wipe off easily with a damp cloth and don't smudge when you are writing Colorful and perfect!

3659005,B00Y3VO332,5,"these are very sharp, bright colored pens.  I use them to label spice jars and bins with baking supplies on which I have placed vinyl ""chalkboard"" stickers and canning jars that have white plastic screw on lids.  They erase easily from those vinyl stickers, but permanently stained the white plastic lids.  The gold and silver pens, as stated, are far more durable and withstand handling much better than the colored pens (i.e. when I'm cooking and handle a bin and accidentally touch the label with wet hands, the writing doesn't rub off with the gold and silver pens, but does with the other colors) lovely colors, work well!"
3659006,B00Y3VO332,5,"My apartment is full of chalk ink signs right now. I just love the vivid, bright colors of these markers. The coverage of color is amazing and there is no chalk dust on my hands. Blami chalk 14 set markers is wonderful. It has 14 liquid chalk pens with gold and silver included. Make sure you use them on nonporous materials (painted chalkboards are porous!) to be able to erase chalk ink later. However, Blami eraser included in this set really makes the whole erasing process much easier (use it damp or with liquid cleaner). Now I don't worry about erasing ink from different surfaces any more.
If you look for a great quality chalk ink pens with a lot of bright colors that can be used on various surfaces, you have found them. I highly recommend them! Perfect Chalk marker Jumbo set"
3659007,B00Y3VO332,5,Fun to play with! Five Stars
3659008,B00Y3VO332,5,"Believe me, Ive tried lots of chalk marker brands but so far any of them offered so much and for such a great price. Blami set has 4 different size markers with reversible or parallel points. Thats great because I can easily write big or extra small signs. I use them on glass and sealed chalkboards. The biggest issue was always erasing chalk ink from surfaces. This set includes erasing sponge (like magic eraser) and when damp, it cleans all chalk ink completely.
Im so glad I bought this set because now I really enjoy making signs of different sizes and they all turn out great. Blami Arts became my preferred brand for chalk markers and labels! Ive just found the ideal chalk marker set for my writings!"

3659013,B00Y3VO332,1,"I tried using these pens on two different chalk surfaces -the actual chalk board and a wall painted with Rust-Oleum chalk board paint. Not only was the opacity inconsistent, it has permenently stained my painted wall. It was OK on the chalk board but still took a lot of effort to wash off and was not consistent. I do not recommend this for chalk walls. Perhaps this is better on black plastic reader boards. The image I've attached is after 4 scrub downs. I probably will have to paint over it. I do NOT recommend this for walls painted with chalk board paint."
3659014,B00Y3VO332,5,"I highly recommend this product and this company! They have such fabulous customer service! My package was lost in the mail (at no fault of Blami - USPS just dropped the ball) and Amazon quickly refunded my purchase. Blami emailed me and asked if I enjoyed my purchase. For the first time ever I replied to a business who emailed me and told them about the situation. I said that I was especially bummed because I really wanted the markers and, ""secretly hoped they would surprise arrive in the mail."" Blami emailed me back and said that they loved surprises and they would send me one for free! Woohoo! I was so happy when I received them and ecstatic when I tried them out on my chalkboard - they are beautiful! Thanks Blami! I highly recommend this product and this company"
3659015,B00Y3VO332,4,"Easy to use, and really liked the quality of the colored markers. Definitely would recommend! Also, I bought them for more of a final / non-temporary project, so I do not intend to clean this board off; I would paint over it if I wanted to change. Easy to use"
3659016,B00Y3VO332,5,"Bought these to decorate my painted chalkboard wall to use as a ""photo booth"" style backdrop for pictures at my mother in law's surprise party. Of all the chalk markers I've tried, these flow the smoothest and longest without having to constantly shake and press as you write. The pink was bright and vibrant, and the few mistakes I made wiped up easily with a wet cloth. I'll definitely buy these again! Perfect!"
3659017,B00Y3VO332,5,Great quality and nice liquid ink. Love the vibrancy of the colors. Nice and good price

3659020,B00Y3VO332,5,"These clean off so much better than other chalk markers.  A lot of the chalk markers I have tried leave a faint residue behind so I was cleaning the board off with a magic eraser before I could reuse to write a new sign.  These markers, however, clean right off and I can reuse my signs instantly.  It doesn't seem like a big gripe, but when we're talking 15-20 signs in a retail establishment, it was taking 30 minutes to write new signs, when now it takes about 10 minutes to erase and rewrite ALL of my signs. Cleanest ones I've used"

3659022,B00Y3VO332,1,"At first use I'd give these markers a 10, however after putting away and taking them out again to use for the second time I was VERY disappointed.
I've followed all directions, I've stored the box right side up and in room temperature storage, I shook them then pressed ... I thought maybe it was only one but after going though the box of colors, I've noticed they are all dried up. VERY UPSET AND DISAPPOINTED TO SAY THE LEAST! Disappointed"
3659023,B00Y3VO332,5,"These markers are perfect! They were easy to start, have bright beautiful colors, and wash off without a problem. They don't have a harsh smell. The tips are firm and two replacement tips are provided. The ink dries quickly, but still comes off easily. I used baby wipes to remove the ink and paper towels to dry the surface and reapply. I will definitely be ordering another pack! Absolutely in love!"

Wasn't happy about it, but was happy to get to test their erasability. Wiped off the old chalk ink with a wet paper towel, let it dry, and then wrote the correct thing over the newly blank spot. Worked perfectly.

These stick well too, and if you LIGHTLY stick them in place, you can move them around (on glass, at least) if you need to make small adjustments. Great labels (and pen)! Works exactly as promised"
3659030,B00Y3VO332,4,"To be honest, I got a bad batch of pens.  Even after tons and tons of shaking to mix the liquid, when writing with them they were runny to the point of dripping down the board, and the color was very watered down.  I loved the options for the colors and usually use another brand but bought these for the metallics, so I was pretty disappointed.  I contacted customer service who immediately responded, apologized and refunded my purchase.
So while the markers were a dud (and hopefully truly just a bad batch), their customer service was exemplary. I got a bad batch of pens"

Be sure to use them on glass or plastic surfaces that are less porous they do stain regular chalkboards as a lot of chalkboard pens do but you can get it off most of the time with Magic Eraser. You just have to watch that as well because some chalkboard paint will come up with the Magic Eraser. Great chalk pens!
3659039,B00Y3VO332,4,"Must use damp cloth to wipe surface clean from chalkboard surfaces, does not dry erase easily. Goes on smoothly and has a great color assortment! Now I know how the restaurants do their fancy chalkboards. Great product!"

3659055,B00Y3VO332,4,"Love the variety of sizes of stickers and the chalk pen is great, very bright white, shows up well. Only thing wrong is the calligraphy side of the pen was broken(fringed/coming apart) so I could only use the round side which makes it a tiny bit harder to do some fancier fonts but it still got the job done. Love how easy it wipes clean. Great pen!"

3659066,B00Y3VO332,5,"Love these markers. They work consistently and can be used for a very long time. I'm a teacher who used them for constant crafts, decorating and labeling. They lasted all year. I will be buying another box for this school year as I have nearly used up some of the most popular colors such as blue, green, pink and purple. Lasted an entire school year!"
3659067,B00Y3VO332,5,The pens are smooth and amazing so far. Do not use on porous surface or you'll end up having a permanent marker. You don't want that. Vibrant pigments!
3659068,B00Y3VO332,4,"Markers look very good on chalkboard . Be careful about the silver and gold ones.  They don't erase easily from a chalkboard. Bright colors on chalkboard.  Careful about the gold and silver colors, however."
3659069,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these markers!! Five Stars
3659070,B00Y3VO332,5,Love!!!! So much fun! Perfect chalk markers
3659071,B00Y3VO332,5,"Had a tiny issue with a few markers and customer service was outstanding. Literally outstanding. They replaced the markers and I received them the same day I received the shipping notification. The new markers work great, the colors are vivid and bright and jump right off the chalkboard. I have used other brands of chalk markers in the past and these blow them right out of the water. They write smooth and evenly and again, the colors are amazing. I would definitely order from them again just based on their customer service alone!! Vivid, bright colors that pop!"
3659072,B00Y3VO332,5,"exactly what I was hoping for.  Very vibrant colors,  great ink flow and easily erasable! exactly what I wanted!"
3659073,B00Y3VO332,2,Nice color choices but it stains my chalkboard that I use to update info on my infant each month. It should come with paint remover :/ Stained my chalkboard :/
3659074,B00Y3VO332,5,
3659076,B00Y3VO332,5,"Such a fun product! We use this on everything from chalk boards (although you really need to test it to make sure it will not leave a shadow of a stain first), White boards, Ceramic and even mirrors! It's a fun way to leave loving messages on your children's mirrors to be found in the morning. I recommend this with loads of confidence that you too will enjoy using them! Great for All Kinds of Writing Fun!"
3659077,B00Y3VO332,1,"Awful product. Does NOT come off. Tried a test spot as recommended, was ok. Used it and left for a few hours and now does not come off. Ruined my daughters easel. Do NOT buy. Does not come off"

3659082,B00Y3VO332,5,I had some issues with my first attempt at Blami Markers but Blami made sure that my needs were met and also sent me a large box for free! I have worked in customer service for years...there just aren't any companies focusing on their customers like this anymore! I felt special indeed! Turns out there was no problem with this product initially...it was the blackboard material that i had ordered. Now I used them in a whiteboard instead. I use them daily and couldn't be anymore impressed. The colors stay vibrant throughout the pens life and not to mention they are ez to get off other surfaces/clothing. I have 3 very artistic kiddos that love them! We like finding new projects to do with these awesome pens! Thank you Blami Arts for your attention. I would rate you guys with 5 stars on the product and A+ in business! Happy happy happy
3659083,B00Y3VO332,5,Beautiful colors! Just don't use them on a chalkboard because it doesn't come off. Beautiful!
3659084,B00Y3VO332,4,Bought for my daughter's chalk board. Very difficult to change out. Super hard to remove. Not easily erasable
3659085,B00Y3VO332,1,Looked great but could not remove it from our chalkboard. Hard to remove
3659086,B00Y3VO332,5,These markers are amazing.  They are opaque but easily erasable on a whiteboard.  I would highly recommend. Awesome Markers for Whiteboards
3659087,B00Y3VO332,5,I paint wine glasses for friends and fundraisers these worked great and very reasonably priced. Great pens
3659088,B00Y3VO332,1,These markers completely stained a chalkboard of mine. I used soap and water as instructed but it still ended up permanently ruining and staining my board even though the ink was only left on for a day. Do not recommend at all. Do not recommend at all
3659089,B00Y3VO332,5,We use these to write our monthly food pick board at the restaurant. Theyre smooth and well pigmented on both glass and chalkboard. Better than the other brand weve used for sure. Better than the other brand weve used for sure

3659094,B00Y3VO332,5,Great product that arrived quickly!  My grandkids love them! LOVE
3659095,B00Y3VO332,5,"These chalk markers are great! They were just what I needed for my chalkboards for a Bridal shower. They wipe off easily with some water *only if you have a real chalkboard*. I say this because some of the boards I bought were cheap and the markers didn't wipe off so great, but that's not the markers fault. Just wanted to throw that out there. Great markers for all your crafting"

3659099,B00Y3VO332,1,"This is more like a ""magic marker"" than chalk, it's difficult to erase if it does at all!  Also the gold and silver don't erase -- more like a permanent marker!  Very disappointed This is more like a ""magic marker"" than chalk"
3659100,B00Y3VO332,4,some of them seem very dry Four Stars
3659101,B00Y3VO332,1,"I ordered 3 sets and all three markers were dry as a bone. I didn't really care about the labels at all, I just wanted the markers and now I have tons of labels and no pens. Dry markers"
3659102,B00Y3VO332,5,
3659103,B00Y3VO332,5,"I love these!  I write on them with a sharpie for my homemade detergent,cleaning supplies, and air freshener. I would recommend them Great!"

3659108,B00Y3VO332,5,These chalk markers are awesome! They work lot better than some other ones I recently bought. They are extremely vibrant! Great markers
3659109,B00Y3VO332,4,Quality brand - couldn't go wrong and wasn't disappointed.  Gold/Silver bonus is pointless since it marks up anything you'd want to use it on. Best on the market
3659110,B00Y3VO332,2,Pretty colors but did not erase easily Two Stars
3659112,B00Y3VO332,5,"Beautiful, vibrant colors that do in fact erase from a regular chalk board. I tested them by making small marks on my chalkboard, and they wiped off cleanly five days later. My favorite is the blue, such a classic! I can't wait to use them on my chalkboard calendar! Beautiful colors!"
3659113,B00Y3VO332,5,We love these markers! We were introduced to them in our grade school's art club and LOVED them! I'm not sure who is more excited for them... Me or my 6 yr old daughter! LOVE THESE!

3659116,B00Y3VO332,5,"The chalk markers are absolutely fabulous! My teenage boys put them to the test and *covered* our windows in art, and the markers performed better than expected! The colors are bright and vibrant, they wipe off easily, and were very easy to handle. Will definitely be buying more! Wonderful company as well, fast and friendly service!!

3659119,B00Y3VO332,1,most of these are too dark/translucent to be visible on standard chalkboards. plus they either drip all over the place or you cant get the chalk to flow--so you can only write only letter before you have to push the nib in to get more down. most of these are too dark/translucent to be visible on ...

3659127,B00Y3VO332,2,Nice colors. Very bright. Big problem - it did not wash off of the chalk board. Nice colors but does not wash off.

3659129,B00Y3VO332,4,"Shows up really well--it's a lot brighter than regular chalk--even on chalkboard. Was afraid it wouldn't come off, but with a little elbow grease and wet paper towel it came off pretty clean. Only giving 4/5 because the black didn't come up completely clean. Bright colors!"

3659131,B00Y3VO332,5,"Blami Arts has been a sponsor and done charity work for our elementary school all this school year. I run an after school arts club that has 250 student participants. That's half of our school! Blami Arts donated enough markers for our entire art club!!
The elementary students in our club would request to use the liquid chalk markers EVERY week, despite what other creative art projects we were doing. I run an after school fine arts club that is educational, and the projects are planned by educated art teachers. The students loved all of our projects, but I was genuinely surprised that these chalk markers were what that were the most interested in. They offer a unique artistic experience to children.
Blami Liquid Chalk Markers beat out ALL other activities we do. We offer print making, ceramics, and paper mache...our students want to do chalk markers the most!
These markers offer students a unique experience in fine arts! They're bright, florescent, and the liquid consistency is fun to experiment with and dries fast so you can keep adding colors for detail.
 I'm so incredibly appreciative of this company's charity work, and Ive seen first hand what their product has offered to children educationally at our elementary school. It's a unique media, and an experience for our children to be creative that's unique. Our art club used these on paper and fell in love with them! I have parents and children from our school that frequently ask me where they can buy them.
I'm just a parent volunteer of a very large, and very successful after school creative art club. These students and parent volunteers in our club genuinely love Blami markers! They are top quality! Colene Hoose Elementary School Art Club"

3659137,B00Y3VO332,4,"Overall, these are amazing quality. However, the gold did stain my chalkboard. I had no other problem with any of the other colors. Beware of the gold marker!"

3659139,B00Y3VO332,5,"Unlike the markers that came with the board I ordered, your markers actually Work! Thank you!!!

My children made some pretty pictures with the full rainbow of colors,  and even my husband was inspired to doodle several cool drawings and designs on strips of black 'chalkboard' tape. We all enjoy the vibrant,  saturated colors. Family Inspired"

3659153,B00Y3VO332,5,Best liquid chalk I've bought. I've tried a few but these started up easier and wrote much smoother  Recommended Five Stars
3659154,B00Y3VO332,2,"Loved the markers when I first got them! All colors were beautiful and vivid! I especially loved the silver and gold!  Now on the flip side, after using them all of 3 times, a couple of colors stopped working.  Also the silver, gold, and white colors stained my chalkboard decal. Literally had to scrub it with a sponge to get it off. The white never completely came off. Had these worked like they were supposed to, had they not stained my board, they would have been amazing! They are just okay"

3659158,B00Y3VO332,1,"These markers are awful! I wrote my shopping list on my chalk board and then 12 hours later tried erasing it but failed. I first tried a chalk eraser and that did like nothing, then a wet paper towel, then a 3M sponge, then some Clorox wipes, it was my final attempt that finally worked. It only took me five seconds to write ""ramen noodles"" but took me five minutes to erase it. I could have eaten a cup of noodles in less than that. Permanent Chalk Markers"
3659159,B00Y3VO332,4,"It is some very nice markers, colors are nice, very easy to use. I have 2 chalkboards, these markers worked great from one of them, but I couldn't get the writings off on the other chalkboard. I've tried damp towels, Windex, it lightened the color but wouldn't completely come off.
Also, some color is more durable than other. For example, I wrote a menu, and I used different color markers. The menu stays outdoor and it was raining. The white, silver and gold hold up well, but the blue, green and orange started bleeding.

Overall I still the markers, it is very fun to use, not messy. It is great for creating some colorful chalkboard artwork. It is some very nice markers, colors are nice"

3659190,B00Y3VO332,5,"I LOVE this product. First, the customer service is AMAZING! I purchased this set and as soon as I got them I wanted to use them for an Easter Chalkboard. I could not get the green marker to work. I tried shaking it, etc. I emailed the company and they immediately sent me a brand new SET of markers. The green worked in the second set. I like the way they have 2 tips you can use and there are also some replacement tips in the box.

UPDATE: I did my chalkboard for Easter. It was on the board for a little over a month. I just tried to get it off and it wouldn't come off. I tried water and clorox wipes. Then I read where someone tried vinegar and a magic eraser and with a little power it came off just fine. I am not blaming the markers, because the board is from Kirklands and it's entirely possible it's porous. Just thought i'd give advice for anyone trying to get it off. Great Customer Service"

The shopping was super fast too. Will buy them again Nice colors and easy to clean"
3659195,B00Y3VO332,2,"Apparently not for all LED lighted boards. This liquid marker is difficult to remove hardening on our coin shop LED board.

3659202,B00Y3VO332,5,"I enjoy them. They write smoothly. You get thick or thin lines. Easy to wash off. It took me a second to get the paint to the tips, but mostly cause I was impatient. Lol. I like these!! Bright, vivid colors!! I enjoy them. They write smoothly"
3659203,B00Y3VO332,2,tends to leak and drip as you write if you do while chalkboard is vertical. leaky
3659204,B00Y3VO332,5,This was a gift for a friend. Her son is in the hospital a lot fighting cancer and a host of other serious health issues. She uses these markers to draw comical pictures on the glass windows in the childrens area of the hospital. This is the brand she prefers Gift for a wonderful cause
3659205,B00Y3VO332,1,"Are you freaking kidding me??????  These do NOT come off chalk boards!!!  I painted a chalk board wall in my house and our first attempt at coloring on said wall is our last with these ridiculous things!  How maddening!  BTW, Gold and Silver are permanent markers.... DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!  You will regret it! PERMANENT MARKERS _ DO NOT BUY - DOES NOT COME OFF"
3659206,B00Y3VO332,5,Perfect for making chalk art. I like that you can use the points at different angle to write fine or bold. Fun to use!
3659207,B00Y3VO332,5,Smooth and bright Great product
3659208,B00Y3VO332,1,"Aside from the red chalk marker, they show up great... so great and bold that they DONT erase! It says for best results to erase by two days, I waited 4 days and I literally can't get the ""chalk"" to budge. I have to buy a new baby monthly milestone chart :(
I used another brand on his name and even after 2 months, that erased easy. Don't erase"
3659209,B00Y3VO332,5,This is a great prodcut! Will be buy more with different colors! Five Stars
3659210,B00Y3VO332,5,"These markers arrived fast and as described.  Once the chalk gets flowing you can use either tip to write and decorate as you choose.  My kids like decorating our windows and making labels and cards.  I don't know how long they will last, but I am happy with the markers. My kids like decorating our windows and making labels and cards"
3659211,B00Y3VO332,5,Nice and vibrant colors. Not so much the gold one though other than that I really like them. Five Stars
3659212,B00Y3VO332,5,"Bought these chalk markers to use in my high school science classroom. Students were thrilled to draw heart diagrams on the lab tables with these markers; their interest was huge, and what could have been a boring review turned into a colorful, artistic activity. I was delighted with the students' engagement and product. Thank you, Blami Arts, for your colorful product and reasonable price. great for science class"
3659213,B00Y3VO332,5,Best chalk markers I've used! Follow the care instructions and they will last a long time Great chalk markers
3659214,B00Y3VO332,5,"Bought these markers for an upcoming art exhibit. LOVE them!

A much richer and cleaner line then just big colored chalk. With a chiseled edge to give you a choice of a finer or bolder line. LOVE them! A much richer and cleaner line then ..."
3659215,B00Y3VO332,4,"The colors are strong, the tip is good, I have one problem with it; when clearing it (especially the lighter colors) there is some residue and sometimes it's hard to clean it just with water. Other than that they are really good. the tip is good, I have one problem with it"
3659216,B00Y3VO332,5,"They're fantastic!!! Great quality, even better price!  Five Stars"
3659217,B00Y3VO332,5,"Good solid color, not transparent like some other chalk markers. Smooth writing, I like the option of chisel tip and round tip. We use these on both chalk boards and clear acrylic Nice markers"
3659218,B00Y3VO332,1,"So disappointed. I was excited to get these and make a mundane schedule fun to post on our weekly chalkboard. The gold is permanent. Period. The other colors are impossible to get off and I'm
Annoyed that I would have to buy an additional item
To remove These are not erasable"
3659219,B00Y3VO332,5,"the markers exceeded my expectations. Not chalky in the least, but looks amazing on a chalkboard surface. Would definitely purchase again... I went to Hobby Lobby a day after receiving my order; and noticed for 6.99 you will only get 6 markers... whereas I paid a little more for 12. Good purchase but looks amazing on a chalkboard surface"
3659220,B00Y3VO332,5,"These are awesome! I was worried about them being vibrant enough to show up clearly on my black chalkboard, but they are great! The only one that is not as bright is the purple. I wish it was a little more pastel so it showed better, but the rest are awesome!!! These are awesome! I was worried about them being vibrant enough ..."
3659221,B00Y3VO332,1,"These markers write beautifully, however they permanently stained my chalk board. I've tried several Clorox wipes and still, there's very obvious residue. Is there any other way the stain can be removed so I can salvage my chalk board? Please help! Help!"

3659225,B00Y3VO332,5,Great fun...remind me of paint pens when I was a  kid! My kids are having a lot of fun with them on chall boards & blue glass bottles we craft with. Great find!
3659226,B00Y3VO332,2,"I purchased these chalk markers four months ago and have been using them weekly (and occasionally more frequently) ever since. I prefer the chisel tip of the reversible marker since I need to write small. Only four of the twelve markers write as small as I need them to (they work, which is why I gave this review two stars instead of one), an additional four write too large despite the 2-mm width as advertised, two smear too much for me to use them and take forever to dry, and the last two smear to the point of runniness, rendering them completely unusable. Moreover, they never dry. (For example, Ive had one color up on my board (a piece of glass) for more than a month now; every time I touch the chalk ink with my finger, it comes off onto my fingertip where I touched, even after all these weeks.) Im glad four of them work and I intend to keep using them until they're used up, but when it comes time to purchase new ones, I will not purchase anything from this company and will certainly not purchase these particular markers again. Some Work, Some Smear, and Some Run -- Not Dependable Or Consistent"
3659228,B00Y3VO332,1,"Used these chalk markers on a regular chalk board. Once dried, they don't come off. Tried all the recommendations and nothing removes the chalk paint. Beware... Poor product - doesn't come off"
3659229,B00Y3VO332,5,Great !! Awesome company
3659231,B00Y3VO332,2,Ok! Two Stars
3659232,B00Y3VO332,5,These write so well! All of the colors have a good base and can't stand on its own on a blackboard. The liquid comes out smooth and consistent. Might be the best chalk markers I've ever purchased. All of the colors have a good base and can't stand on its own on a ...

3659239,B00Y3VO332,1,"New Review- I have been using these to track my belly weekly as I am pregnant.  I had planned to use a bigger chalk board which I drew a quick border on and tested how they erased.  While erasable immediately I found if left on for a week they are no longer eraseable.  So I switched to my frame with glass and black scrapbook paper instead.  The markers have enough color to write one large number and that is it.  Never usable again.  If you are trying to write double or triple thick forget about it.  When you try to make a line thicker it erases what you already wrote. Some of the colors go on way better than others.  The orange was so thin it wasn't even opaque.  I was super excited because I thought the red was going to be great because the 1 in 10 went on perfect but then I apparently used too much color because I can barely get the 0 on at all.  I'm still trying to make the 0 usable but was so frustrated I decided to update this review.  These were a waste of money!

Original Review-
I bought a cheap frame with plastic ""glass."" I took that plastic out and painted it with chalk board spray paint.  Chalk just wasn't giving me the effect I wanted so I decided to give these markers a try, even though some of the reviews complained about not erasing all the way.  I made a simple border on the chalk board just in case it didn't erase but it came off easy!  The markers are bright and will work great for my purpose.  Then I tried it on a secondary frame for fun with actual glass. I filled it with black scrapbook paper and wrote with the gold.  It was beautiful and wiped off the glass easily.  Per instructions everywhere I did not try the gold or silver on my chalkboard.  Overall these did exactly what I wanted.  They wrote crisp bright lines that were easily erased with a wet paper towel. Edited to talk about how horrible these are after all."
3659240,B00Y3VO332,1,VERY difficult to use. One Star
3659241,B00Y3VO332,5,"Love them! Very smooth writing, no mess and easy to erase. Blame Chalk Pens"
3659243,B00Y3VO332,4,My children liked it very much. Four Stars
3659244,B00Y3VO332,5,Love! I like the neon colors and they come off of my magnetic dry erase board on my fridge with a simple wet paper towel! super easy Love!
3659245,B00Y3VO332,5,Writes beautifully on the glass windows. Ideal for writing out equations etc and an alternative to having white boards in your study -- Just write stuff out on the windows and create some beautiful window art! Writes beautifully on the glass windows
3659246,B00Y3VO332,5,Love my new Blami chalk markers . . Very vibrant colors with great coverage!! Best Pirchas
3659247,B00Y3VO332,5,Vivid.  Would purchase again. Vivid. Would purchase again.
3659248,B00Y3VO332,4,"These things are great but you have to know what you're getting here. 1) they will not come off of porous chalk boards or chalk paint. The description tells you that. They are not a general replacement for all chalk! The market for chalk is still live and there's a reason for that.

What these are good for is Windows and surfaces made specifically for them. If you're not sure then test a small amount on a tiny area of the material first. They most certainly come off of glass.

Yes the gold and silver is much harder to remove than the others which come off of glass easily with damp paper towel. I would not use the gold and silver on any textured surface even if non-porous because they will be harder to remove. Save the gold and silver for window decorations.

Also, even though these are safe for three year olds they're not necessarily such a good idea for three year olds. My niece had a tendency to touch her clothes with them and seemed to delight in covering her palm with the chalk paint stuff. So these are probably better for 5+ when they're more conscious of what they're touching the tip against. These are great if you know what you're doing"
3659249,B00Y3VO332,5,These markers are great!! My daughter really likes all the colors! Great markers!
3659250,B00Y3VO332,5,Beautiful colors!  Liquid chalk flowed from tip evenly and easily right from the start. Beautiful colors!

Good luck in your business Best markers"
3659255,B00Y3VO332,5,"The colors are bright, the ink flow is perfect (not too runny, not too dry).  My children love writing their spelling words on the mirrors in the bathroom so they can review them every time they are in there.  I never thought I could use these crafty (fun for me) buy as an advantage to help my boys with their spelling words but it has been the main reason they are used now.  We love them! Kids Spelling Improved! "
3659256,B00Y3VO332,2,"Most of the markers work well. some did not and the tips easily broke.
would not buy again and wouldn't recommend.

Also make sure you read the smaller print about the gold and silver markers! they may be permanent to your chalkboard is it is porous! Eh.. not worth it"
3659257,B00Y3VO332,5,These are great chalk markers with bright colors. Easy to use and liquid flows well. Great seller too. Quality markers

3659261,B00Y3VO332,2,"I bought these chalk pens for use on the chalkboard wall I have in my home office.  I was extremely pleased with them initially as the colors are extremely vibrant and they write very well with their reversible tips (rounded or chisel).

My first doodle was a mini countdown clock for an upcoming vacation.  I went to update the day count 24 hours later and the numbers would not fully erase despite my best efforts.  Soapy water, Windex, and even the Mr Clean Magic Eraser would still leave visible writing behind.  Now I'm stuck repainting over my initial artwork...guess I'm going back to regular chalk.

Blami should clearly state that these will not work on Chalkboard walls.  It appears from other reviews that these are better on other surfaces. Chalkboard Walls BEWARE!!!"
3659263,B00Y3VO332,4,The colors are great but I wish I had known before buying that the metallic colors are permanent! Four Stars
3659264,B00Y3VO332,5,"I'm enjoying this purchase. I took the recommendation to not use the silver / gold on the chalk board at our restaurant, eM . So far, so good. Easy to remove with a damp rag and the colors are brighter than the last chalk markers I used.

In short, I'd will buy them again  Bright Chalk Markers!"
3659265,B00Y3VO332,5,"Love them! The only thing is I didn't know it's hard to erase from non porous material. So, as soon as I got them, I wrote on my chalkboard... sad... but I love them. I'm gonna use them for my pantry labels!!! Love them! The only thing is I didn't know ..."
3659266,B00Y3VO332,5,"We needed to get our family organized with a message center. Immediately!! We ordered these markers for a black whiteboard, not sure this was even the right product for the job. They write in bright colors and stand out beautifully against the dark background!! Takes a minute or two to prime the liquid chalk to the tip, but after primed, they work beautifully!!! Great quality product! Fast delivery!"
3659267,B00Y3VO332,5,Wonderful! Perfect for my nameplates in my rabbit house! Wonderful
3659268,B00Y3VO332,5,This chalk is great! It writes smoothly on my IKEA blackboard. Didn't notice the warning on the box about GOLD&SILVER colors stains until I tried them. The blackboard has the gold stains remaining after I tried really hard to clean with a wet mop. It is fine though~ Recommend Quality product
3659270,B00Y3VO332,5,"Love these markers.  Vibrant colors. It doesn't come off if you swipe your hand over it. It also deters your students from accidentally wiping away your board.

Works on whiteboards and chalkboards.

Now if only you guys sell specific colors in bundles. Awesome for classroom"
3659272,B00Y3VO332,5,great for writing on car glass. Five Stars
3659273,B00Y3VO332,4,I find that some of the colors don't show up very well. That's the only reason for the 4. Otherwise great product. Otherwise great product.

3659275,B00Y3VO332,4,"I have labeled everything with these! So excited about them! The color is so bright and neon. It shows up on my white toy buckets, clear plastic drawer units, white fridge, and bathroom mirrors. They are quite fun for me and the kids. The only downfall is that they stain my command center's blackboard. Windex works ok to diminish the staining. Plus elbow grease. Organizing mama"

3659277,B00Y3VO332,4,"We had chalkboard installed as our stair risers.  Did some testing before putting chalk on.  These work really good, bright colors, but the silver and gold do not come off.  Had to use rubbing alcohol and then there was still residue.  The other colors do come off. These work really good, bright colors"

3659279,B00Y3VO332,4,"Once it dries, the chalk is extremely hard to get off chalkboard. It takes some good old-fashioned elbow grease. Very pretty and bright colors, though! It takes some good old-fashioned elbow grease"

3659286,B00Y3VO332,2,"DO NOT USE THE SILVER & GOLD!!!!  They are permanent and it doesn't say it anywhere on the packaging.  Unless you don't plan on erasing it, do not use. SILVER & GOLD ARE PERMANENT"
3659287,B00Y3VO332,1,Will have to return these. Luckily I tried the markers (purple and green) on an inconspicuous corner of my chalkboard. The marker will not erase. I tried water first and then cleaning solution. Be careful if you intend to use for chalkboards

3659291,B00Y3VO332,1,"I purchased this product on August 18th and they appeared to work great! However, I only use these monthly to update my chalkboard calendar. By the time I went to use them in November -- my third month using them - 6 of them had no ink remaining in them. I contacted the company by email with this concern on November 21 and received this response: ""Dear Lauren,
We are surprised to hear that even after non constant use some of the chalk markers in your set already don't work. This shouldn't have happened. Sometimes it helps if you shake markers again to mix the ink inside.
If that doesn't help, are we more than willing to send you a new set of Blami liquid chalk pens for free to prove they are the product that satisfies customers.
We believe in a good quality of our products and want to offer only the best to our customers.
If you agree with our offer, please, send us your full address and we'll send you marker set right away.""

-- I tried what they recommended and this did not help. I emailed the company that night with my address and after emailing them again on December 27th when I still had not received a replacement order. Today I realized that 2 more of my markers no longer work, so after 4 months I have only 4 markers that work. So much for offering the best to their customers. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY"
3659292,B00Y3VO332,5,Received my Blami Arts Chalk Markers and I'm loving using them for my A-frames in the front of my store!! Plus the customer service is SUPERB! Love these!
3659293,B00Y3VO332,5,"Out of all my markers, Blami Markers are the most vibrant in colors. I really enjoy them, I do hope they continue to make more colors. Very bright and solid colors!!!!"
3659294,B00Y3VO332,5,"I wish I had known about these earlier.  I use them to label everything.  All the stress I used to have using a sharpie 'forever' went away.  Obviously you can not use on things that will get wet, but what a great way to label and relabel things easily!  Fun for the kids to use on windows and mirrors too.  I leave little messages on the mirror for them for reminders or just for fun but what a great way to label and relabel things easily"

3659296,B00Y3VO332,5,"The one time we used the markers, they worked great! However, our dog saw how great they worked and decided he wanted to become an artist as well. After chewing through them, he made a great tie-dye painting on our carpet :/  On the bright side, the markers came out with relative ease using a mini-steamer we have. We will be ordering replacements soon! they worked great! However"
3659297,B00Y3VO332,5,"I love these! Wish my white one didn't get used up as quickly, but I use them every day so it's understandable. Honestly, at first, I wasn't completely prepared for them to not come off easily off of chalkboards, but I'm actually very okay with it. I use the chalk markers for the boards at a restaurant, and since it's been raining and snowing, nothing will wipe these off! Unfortunately you have to invest in some magic erasers and elbow grease, but there's always coupons for magic erasers!
Overall awesome product, now just looking for a pack of white markets from this brand. I love these! Wish my white one didn't get used ..."

3659300,B00Y3VO332,2,"These chalk marker DONT wash off of blackboards completely, so unless you want something permanent, beware. Two Stars"
3659301,B00Y3VO332,4,"Like another reviewer, I selected this product because of the gold and silver markers. Thank goodness I only used them in a small area (New Years Eve in the Pic) before reading that they are not to be used on chalk boards. I had a heck of a time getting that spot out (had to use my fingernail). I don't believe they should be packaged alongside the others if they don't perform to the same expectation.

That being said, the other markers work great and erase with ease. They are nice and bright :) Bummed about the Gold and Silver."
3659302,B00Y3VO332,5,"These chalk markers are great.  I had original bought them to use in scrap booking.  The are a thicker and bulkier chalk marker but work great.  They also since buying them found out through the company that they are also good for using on storage containers and on zip lock bags for the fridge and freezer.  So we did try them out this holiday season, and they do work amazing.  They stay on in fridge and freezer with bold print and was off easily with your dish soap, making them easy to use on other items you are going to place in them for the fridge or freezer. Great for fridge and freezer labeling!"
3659303,B00Y3VO332,5,"Love these markers. The colors are vibrant, the ink lasts a long time. The edge of the market is beveled so I can use a fine marker or color in the lines. The edge of the market is beveled so I can use a fine marker or color in the lines"
3659304,B00Y3VO332,5,Happy with my purchase. Great item
3659305,B00Y3VO332,5,"These are great-had no problems removing from a chalkboard. As noted in the package, the metallic are only to be used on no-porous surfaces. Seller is very prompt and enthusiastic. Awesome Chalk Markers"
3659306,B00Y3VO332,1,"Most of them work, but some of them are completely out of ink, so... One Star"
3659307,B00Y3VO332,5,"Beautiful colors. If your chalkboard is at all porous, the chalk can leave faint ghost lines--you might need a ""magic sponge"" to clean it. Beautiful, sharp colors"
3659310,B00Y3VO332,5,I used the markers on chalk tape as a decoration for a tablecloth.  They were beautiful.  I especially liked the silver. Loved them!!!
3659311,B00Y3VO332,5,I bought this for my daughter who loves to decorate a big chalkboard in her diningroom. We were very impressed with the vibrancy of the chalk-paint! Great product! Loved it so much I bought another box for my other daughter. Bought 2 boxes because we loved it!
3659312,B00Y3VO332,1,"Wow. I tested 2 of the boards I wrote on before I used this 'chalk' ... I understand it says non-porous but I guess what that really means is that it can't write on a chalk board.  I used this chalk on three boards in my house for the holidays, today I tried to wipe it off with 2 types of cleaner and just plan water and NOTHING is coming off.  Both of these were boards I bout at small specialty shops so they won't be replaced. I'm beyond bummed.  If these cant write in chalk boards they should not be advertised as such! BUMMER!!! NOT FOR CHALKBOARDS!"
3659313,B00Y3VO332,5,"I got these for my ""to do"" list on my bathroom mirror.  It helps me remember things I need to do that day.  I also love to write motivational phrases occasionally.  My niece visited over the holidays and wrote a long message using every color.  One thing to note is that it only takes a clean tissue to remove.  Rub in circles and change the cleaning spot when it's full.  If you tried the tissue and a few spots aren't coming off, then try the windex.  I haven't had any problems removing any markings yet.  However, I have made it a point to not leave any in place for too long (2 weeks so far)  as I'm renting and don't want to risk any shadows or marks left behind. Motivational & TO DO list"
3659314,B00Y3VO332,5,"Awesome pens, bought for my dart and shuffleboard chalk board. Vibrant colors and erases easily. Great product. Excellent chalk markers, great quality."
3659316,B00Y3VO332,1,"The front of the box states these are good for chalkboard. So I used them on the chalkboard. After cleaning up I noticed in small print on the back that the bonus silver and gold markers are not to be used on a chalkboard as they will be permanent on the board.  Seriously?? Why include two markers that can't be used on a chalkboard. And yes, those 2 did stain my Board. The other colors were fine and came off good.  One star strictly because of my Board being ruined and I think most people wouldn't know to read the fine print on the back. The front of the box states these are good for chalkboard"
3659318,B00Y3VO332,5,"Wonderful item. Needed chalk markers, and JoAnn's and Michaels Craft store had very limited selection.
These have two tips you can use, one pointed tip (good for fine lines, not good for filling in), and one flat/wide tip (not good for fine lines, but good for filling in). You just take the tip out, flip it around, and put it back in the other way.
FYI: Follow the directions for getting the marker chalk/ink flowing into the tip. Great product."
3659319,B00Y3VO332,5,Best chalk markers I have ever used. Wish they came in different colors. Will definitely buy again. The best out there!
3659320,B00Y3VO332,5,Great product for Chalk Wall in kitchen - fun! Five Stars
3659321,B00Y3VO332,5,"At first I posted a not so good review, but I removed it.  After playing around with these, I finally got the ink to work.  Once the tip is filled with ink, they are beautiful, the purple is not as bright as I wish it was but still works. Much better than I initially thought."
3659322,B00Y3VO332,5,These are perfect for so many crafts! Great quality- would definitely purchase again Five Stars
3659323,B00Y3VO332,5,These markers are wonderful. Bright and colorful and write beautifully! Definitely a wise purchase. Five Stars
3659326,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these they're sooo fun! Fun times!
3659328,B00Y3VO332,1,"It says Liquid Chalk but you can't use on a chalk board, mis leading One Star"
3659329,B00Y3VO332,5,"Very nice especially the dual tips! But must say, the gold looks a bit yellow instead of gold. Pictured is the gold and silver markers. Silver is beautiful though! Worth the price!"
3659330,B00Y3VO332,5,The colours are lovely and work well - very good value - fast efficient shipping Five Stars
3659331,B00Y3VO332,5,Very nice replacement for normal chalks.  The colors are very vibrant and a lot easier to do detailed drawing/lettering than brittle chalk.  I am using to mark up blackboard beer tap signs as the kegs are replaced.  Clean up very nice with a little bit of water on a towel. Very nice replacement for normal chalks
3659332,B00Y3VO332,5,"Great markers
Much better than chalk Great markers Much better than chalk"
3659333,B00Y3VO332,5,These are great! The tips are reversible for bold and flat writing. Even comes with extra tips. The bold worked better for me. I used chalk paint to paint some wood stars then used these markers to write names to make ornaments. Great variety. Exactly what I needed
3659334,B00Y3VO332,5,Worked well on my chalkboard and erased easily.  Like that they each have two different types of tips. Nice!
3659335,B00Y3VO332,5,My daughter LOVES these. They work great on our chalkboard. They wipe clean with a damp rag. They work great on our chalkboard
3659336,B00Y3VO332,2,Stains chalk board paint very easily Two Stars
3659337,B00Y3VO332,5,What an amazing product!! These chalk markers served their purpose well for me as I needed them to show up on a black piece of foam board. The color is so vibrant and consistent. I literally wrote with these chalk markers as if I were using a pencil; it was so small org and easy. I whipped up this foam board for my daughter's 1st birthday. Vibrant & Easy
3659338,B00Y3VO332,5,"I've only tested them and have not used them on a project nut colors are great and seems like they will work very well, ... not used them on a project nut colors are great and seems like they will work very well"
3659339,B00Y3VO332,5,Awesome chalk markers Five Stars
3659340,B00Y3VO332,5,"First time using them last night and I absolutely love them. The color is bright and applies easily. The tip didn't seem to gunk up at all. I only used the red and the green so I can't speak to all of the colors just yet, but I can't wait to use the gold and the silver!! Love them!"
3659341,B00Y3VO332,5,Great pens Five Stars
3659342,B00Y3VO332,1,The pens have great color and I was excited to get them to use on my chalkboard for my granddaughter. One use and it ruined my chalkboard. Most of it is stained and some won't even come off. I'm very disappointed. I will never use these again! Stained chalkboard
3659343,B00Y3VO332,5,these are a great price and the colors are great. Five Stars
3659344,B00Y3VO332,5,These chalk markers are really great!! The colors are nice and bright and they look wonderful. The customer services from this company is outstanding! Buy these markers if you want high quality!!
3659345,B00Y3VO332,5,I ordered these to write on my beer tap handle which has a glossy black surface. Amazing!  These work awesome and wipe right off of a smooth surface. Great chalk markers
3659346,B00Y3VO332,4,"Markers worked. The gold looks more like a bronze. Otherwise, they worked quite well. Chalk markers"
3659347,B00Y3VO332,5,"Loved my markers. Two notes to add, wish they didn't have the indention inside the cap--caused me to mess up the tips. (You could provide spare tips to alleviate this.) Also, wish it came with a back up white marker, it's the color primarily used on chalkboards. Loved my markers"
3659348,B00Y3VO332,5,Thank you. My son will love these for Christmas. My son will love these for Christmas
3659349,B00Y3VO332,5,Wonderful chalk markers. I've never seen a gold or silver and these fit the bill. I need more of these with a super fine tip now! Excellent quality!
3659350,B00Y3VO332,5,"They actually work really well on desks, white boards, lab tables, etc  and are much less messy than regular chalk.  Plus the colors are more vibrant and easy to see.  If others are looking for something other than Expo to write on desks because they don't stain and wipe off easily/quickly with damp towel. Works Great!"
3659351,B00Y3VO332,5,Got them really quick and they work just like they are supposed to. Love the colors that come in the package. I bought these as a gift for someone. Got them really quick and they work just like they are supposed to

3659356,B00Y3VO332,5,"These markets are vibrant and are so much cleaner than chalk. They are easy to write with.
I use windex to clean the marker off the chalkboard and it cleans off quite well.
Customer service from this company is excellent. They email to make sure you received the markers in a timely manner.
Highly recommend! A cleaner, more vibrant, option for chalkboards!"
3659357,B00Y3VO332,4,"I was excited to try these out. I've tracked lots of different chalk on my blackboard. These are easy to use, write wonderfully & great instructions. But, they don't erase well. As shown in picture, you can see my turkey artwork. Hopefully after a few drawings it will start to blend in a bit.

Update: Mr. Clean magic erasers COMPLETLY clean away the marker!!! Easy to Use, Slight color left behind"
3659358,B00Y3VO332,4,"These look like really nice markers. They were bought as a gift for my son's girlfriend, to use for her Baby Board. I will ask her how she likes them when I see her as she won't be moving into my son's house until her current lease is up.
The color look amazing, though! Bought for a gift"
3659359,B00Y3VO332,5,Such a great product! Works great and loved the extra gold and silver markers that came with it! Perfect colors for the holidays! Great product!
3659360,B00Y3VO332,5,Amazing products. Love how bright and vibrant the colors are and how durable they are. We used them from 4 years old child to a 40 year old adult and we all loved them. You can use them on paper and on a chalk board. Hit the add button
3659361,B00Y3VO332,5,"These are AWESOME!  Have used them everywhere from chalkboards to dry erase boards to advertise for upcoming events in the company I work for.  Easy to use!  When using on chalkboards, they aren't easy to erase, but I have used Mr. Clean Magic Erasers and they have come off...not sure if the Mr. Clean will change the color on a black chalk board though. These are AWESOME! Have used them everywhere from chalkboards to dry ..."

3659364,B00Y3VO332,4,"Easy to write , turns out beautifully. Only flaw is tht it doesn't erase easily. I use the white chalk marker and got a damp cloth and it didn't wipe away. It fade after scrubbing really hard. Please let me know if there is an easier way to erase. Other than it writes well. Easy to write"
3659365,B00Y3VO332,2,Chalk markers do not remove well from this calendar. Two Stars
3659366,B00Y3VO332,1,"There are two markers in this box that are labeled 'chalk', but are not meant to be used on a chalkboard. Very disappointed in this since I now have a ruined chalkboard. Not sure why they would do this, but I'm not happy about it! Some of this chalk is not actually chalk"
3659367,B00Y3VO332,1,"These chalk markers ruined a set of 8 mini chalk boards. I used the markers to make ""menu"" signs, and tried to erase after 5 hours. They did not erase with water, soap, or any other cleaning solutions. I will need to throw away the boards. Also, I know the problem was with the markers and not the chalk boards, because I have used these boards for 2 years with CraftSmart chalk markers and those erased perfectly.  I only switched to Blami for the extra colors, and now wish I had not! Do not erase - ruined all chalk boards!"
3659368,B00Y3VO332,5,"Easy to use, vibrant colors, great color selection. Lids can be tricky for children to put on without damaging the tips. Easy to use"

3659378,B00Y3VO332,5,"What an exciting classroom discovery!!! My students love the look of these chalk markers, and I have started using them on file cabinets, windows and other surfaces, too. They're so easy, clear to read, and washable. All the teachers who see my objectives posted in these bright colors want me to order them a pack! Definitely my discovery of the year! My students love the look of these chalk markers"
3659379,B00Y3VO332,5,"Love these, and their ease of use. Loads of colors. A little hard to erase off of my chalk board. Not sure if it is the product or the chalk board quality. I had to erase it with acetone. Will be repainting my chalkboard to see if it helps. Loads of colors for a great price"
3659380,B00Y3VO332,4,"The gold and silver are beautiful but not good for a small craft chalkboard. Very hard to clean off, scrubbed a portion of the board off trying to clean it. The colors are much easier to clean. The flow is nice, the tips are nice. Easy to use and very pretty. Beautiful and easy to use"
3659381,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these markers. We're using them  on an LED board and the colors are fantastically brilliant. This was a wonderful purchase and the company was speedy in delivery! Love these markers!

3659388,B00Y3VO332,4,"I love the chalk markers, they are so fun!  My grandkids will love them when they come home for Christmas!  Only down side I had was when I put the cap back on, you have to guide the marker in exactly because if you ""jam"" it in cap, it can catch on sides of marker and distort your future writings with marker. Love the markers!"

3659398,B00Y3VO332,5,Great product Five Stars
3659399,B00Y3VO332,5,"Very vibrant and easy to use.  There are a few replacement felt heads included in case one is damaged, etc.  Thry dry very quick when you write/draw so if you want to blend, act fast! Very vibrant and easy to use"

3659401,B00Y3VO332,5,"I wrote a previous review on these markers which included the statement below.
""I messed up the tips on two of them because of the cap design. If you don't have the cap at the correct angle when capping the marker the cap splits the tip.  I give it three stars because of the cap design.""
My quote caught the attention of Blami Arts, which surprised me. They contacted me and said that they had used my suggestion and changed the cap design and offered to send me a new set free of charge. I accepted their offer and they have changed the cap design and I have to say the new cap is excellent! I originally gave this product a 3 star rating but have changed it to 5 stars based on the new cap design and the excellent customer service I received. I have not ever had a company contact me, use my suggestion, or treat me with such respect.
The markers are excellent markers for nonporous surfaces, they are bright and easy to use. The price is excellent! Revised review."

3659403,B00Y3VO332,5,"Beautiful, rich colors. The pens write smoothly and the lines don't bleed. I've used them in a chalkboard and chalkboard paper. I plan to give them as gifts now that I've tried them. Better than expected."
3659404,B00Y3VO332,5,The colours are SO bright and vivid! They're PERFECT for posters  of any size for any reason! Awesome chalk markers!
3659405,B00Y3VO332,5,"These chalk markers work really well. I have used them for signage at my business. They work great for any art/writing on windows, mirrors, and they create wonderfully bold lines on chalkboard. I haven't tried removing the writing from my chalkboard after it dried completely, but it comes off of windows extremely easily. This stuff looks so much better than regular old chalk writing! Works well!"
3659406,B00Y3VO332,5,"GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! One of chalk pen was defective. The whole box was returned and they replaced a new one at no cost. I have been a loyal amazon customer for years, and this seller Blami Arts has far exceeded my expectation. They responded me in a promptly manner.

The colors are vibrant and show up beautifully against the black, and I'll probably donate all the others to Goodwill. These are by far the best. The colors are vibrant and show up beautifully against the black"
3659410,B00Y3VO332,5,"Applies smoothly like paint. Looks and behaves like chalk. On paper, creates interesting effects like chalk or pastels. Writes on glass and dry erase boards. Erases easily and doesn't seem to bother people who are bothered by the smell of dry erase markers. A new favorite"

3659425,B00Y3VO332,5,These are great! Five Stars
3659426,B00Y3VO332,4,"Decent chalk markers, with lovely colors that are vibrant. The negatives are: the gloppiness that you must get going every time you use a marker to start the flow of chalk; the tendency of many of the markers to stain the chalkboard if not washed off within 24 hours; the permanent markings of the metallic markers (both silver and gold have ruined sections of chalkboard and cannot be removed); tips that are at best slightly frayed and at worst breaking and stringing out in many directions.

I wanted to love these, but because they are so messy, I limit their use to mom only, and even I tend to avoid using them because they can stain the chalkboard. They are easily removed with a wet towel, but if writing has been up for more than 24-48 hours, distinct shadows remain behind after washing. I've had to stop using any towel in the kitchen as the chalk stains towels. OK markers, not for casual household use."
3659427,B00Y3VO332,5,"They write vibrantly and beautifully! They clean off easily.  Got a lot of compliments!  I used these on my ""Board Dudes 17"" x 23"" Chalk Board with Oak Trim"" Chalkboard.  Very happy with both! Beautiful color, easy to use!"
3659428,B00Y3VO332,5,"I am very satisfied with this product!  These markers write smoothly, erase well, and are not too messy (although make sure the cap is on when you shake them!).  The colors are vibrant and look great against my black chalkboard.  It is also worth noting the excellent customer service I received when one of my markers was damaged. I am very satisfied with this product"

3659433,B00Y3VO332,2,"Gold and silver are not for chalk board they don't wipe off other colors are fine.
The tips are plane standard size no fine points or wide for fancy writing.
Also need water to clean chalk off board Little messy for kids"
3659435,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these on my black dry erase board. Very vibrant. easy to erase with a dry paper towel. I did use a bit moisture in the metallic colors. They arrived quickly. One didn't work but that is probably very unusual. The company promptly replaced it. I will definitely buy from them again. Great
3659436,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these markers!!!  The colors are super vibrant.  Great customer service from this company.  Will definitely continue to do business with them!!! Love these markers!!!
3659437,B00Y3VO332,5,Great Markers.  Work very well.  Pretty colors.  Tip of marker works very well. Great markers.  Vivid colors
3659438,B00Y3VO332,5,"I was worried they would be difficult to use.  Much to my surprise, if you follow the directions which are easy in themselves, all is good.  Lots of different colors.  They actually look great on my pantry storage jars Love these"
3659439,B00Y3VO332,4,"If you plan on making your own chalkboard using wood, make sure its for a permanent project. it doesn't wash off completly. the colors are perfect. very happy with colors the colors are perfect. very happy with"
3659441,B00Y3VO332,4,Great markers! Four Stars
3659442,B00Y3VO332,5,I love this product! I wish they had more colors. They worked exactly like I needed for my son's birthday chalk board I made using a black canvas. And when I messed up it came right off the canvas with a wet cloth. PLEASE PLEASE make some more colors. Preferably a dark blue and yellow. The neon yellow didn't work for my son's theme. LOVE!!!
3659443,B00Y3VO332,5,quality chalk pens! 2 thumbs up Five Stars
3659444,B00Y3VO332,5,Great! Bold colors and love that I can reverse the tip to something more narrow :) Five Stars
3659445,B00Y3VO332,1,Save your $!!!! If you purchase these be sure to purchase chalk paint as well because the gold & silver should be labeled as permanent marker! Save your $!!!! If you purchase ...
3659446,B00Y3VO332,5,This is great stuff!! The colors are very true. If you follow the directions they are easy to use. Five Stars
3659447,B00Y3VO332,4,"Nicely packaged and quickly delivered. Having the option to switch the tip is very nice. Colors are very bright, was hoping the yellow, pink and green would not be as neon as they turned out to be. The gold and silver do not erase, so make sure you know exactly what you want to write as you will not be able to wipe it off neatly. Nicely packaged and quickly delivered"
3659448,B00Y3VO332,1,"So the markers go on beautifully, but definitely not for chalkboards. I guess I should have read a bit more about them, I just figured it was safe to assume that chalk markers worked on chalkboards... call me crazy... very disappointed and confused as to what makes them ""chalk"" markers. Attached is a photo of my test board- the word ""show"" has been erased with water and then windex. So the markers go on beautifully, but definitely not for chalkboards"
3659449,B00Y3VO332,5,The markers are really groovy.  I bought them to use on chalkboard paper because regular chalk looked messy when used and then erased.  The colors look vibrant and when wiped off with just water they come off easy without a trace.  Very nice! I dig 'em
3659450,B00Y3VO332,4,"Love the brightness of the chalk
markers. Only issue is the gold marker is really hard to take off. Other colors that I have tried so far were not bad to erase off the board. Just a simple swipe with a cloth or even your hand :)
I haven't tried the silver, but I'm guessing it might have the same issue as gold. We will see. Others are perfect though.
Tip: I wouldn't pair it with some of the cheaply made magnetic boards out there. Gold sucks others are great"
3659451,B00Y3VO332,5,"Very bright markers, dry fast and cover lines completely. The gold and silver are shimmery and opaque. I wish they made fine line chalk markers as well..maybe I have to research more  Awesome markers."
3659452,B00Y3VO332,5,Great working quality markers.  Colors are vibrant.  I use on a flat surface chalk board and glass.  Take heed the directions on using only non porous surface otherwise the chalk marker will not come off easily if at all.  Also GOLD AND SILVER bonus markers really should apply this. Great working vibrant & quality markers. Great value
3659453,B00Y3VO332,5,"Perfect chalk markers for my project! Easy to use and vibrant colors. Recycled a rusty old fridge into a beer fridge with a keg inside. Painted it with chalkboard paint and added a duct tape border. Once the tap is set up we will list the ""beer on tap"" on the door. Fun project! With the holidays I'll be using the markers on mirrors and windows too! Love that I had 2 tip options to choose from. These chalk markers are fantastic!"
3659454,B00Y3VO332,1,"These liquid chalk markers are impossible to get off of chalk boards.  I used them on mini chalk boards for my classroom as well as a chalk board calendar.  After using numerous products, I put the markers away and will not use them again, they ruined my boards. Very Disappointed"
3659455,B00Y3VO332,2,"The Free Gold and Silver Markers are not to be used on chalkboards.  I ruined a wedding present because I cannot erase the Gold Chalk Paint from our ""Welcome Guests""  ChalkBoard.  I've tried removing the gold chalk with water, abrasive sponges, paint thinner, but nothing will remove it.  The only warning is in small print and it's not obvious that the GOLD and SILVER are not to be used as Chalk.  Blami should omit these useless markers and include 2 extra white markers. Gold and Silver markers are NOT to be used on chalkboards or any porous material."
3659456,B00Y3VO332,5,"These markers are super cool.  I let my kids draw on a window of our home with them and they are perfect for that.  We do holiday designs or just doodle.  The colors are vibrant and even if the images are on the window for weeks, it easily cleans off with window cleaner.
We make different are projects with these. We did some art about 10 months ago on tin foil.  It was super fun to experiment.  We didn't frame the tin foil art or anything -- just left them sitting in our art pile and they still look nice.
I imagine these would be wonderful for a business that advertises on their windows or who had chalkboard signs or menus. Perfect if you need something temporary and durable"
3659457,B00Y3VO332,5,"Great markers, perfect for any style chalkboard. The tips are a bit sensitive but the package gives you that warning. Would buy again. Perfect"
3659458,B00Y3VO332,5,These make me wanna draw stuff! Fun to use and great color. Noice
3659459,B00Y3VO332,5,"The markers wrote very clear, smooth and pretty! They cleaned off well which doesn't always happen with this type of product. They were fast on shipping too!! I appreciated the reasonable pricing. smooth and pretty! They cleaned off well which doesn't always happen ..."
3659460,B00Y3VO332,5,Easy to use... clear and fun to create just about any design! Five Stars
3659461,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these Chalk Markers. Just remember if you use the brown or darker colors you might not see them as clearly on black background as you might want to. Otherwise I love these markers. The possibility that you can change from marker to chisel marker is great. I am already working on my Halloween projects. Great purchase
3659462,B00Y3VO332,5,I accidentally used the silver and gold before I read that they are permanent :/ So they are :) But they all work great and I love them! I just need to learn to read before I use things! Great Markers!
3659463,B00Y3VO332,5,This was EXACTLY what I was looking for. It's the cleanest way to use chalk. It writes easily and erases the exact same way. I will never go back to using regular chalk again. I use it to maintain a chalkboard calendar of my crazy schedule. Now I can finally read it. Thank you! Best chalk- clean and easy
3659465,B00Y3VO332,1,They are not as bright as I hoped. I can barely see them on chalkboard. Really disappointed. Really disappointed.
3659466,B00Y3VO332,5,Great markers and colors. Perfect for my Halloween decor project. Five Stars
3659467,B00Y3VO332,5,"Great, wiped off clean after I used on the chalk boards. Didn't leave any residue and only needed water to wipe clean. Love them!"
3659468,B00Y3VO332,5,"I ordered these markers to use at my 40th Birthday party.
We used them to write our names on our wine glasses and beer mugs!
I followed the instructions on the box to prep the markers and they worked fabulously!
We had so much fun that the drawing continued onto the house windows!
The next morning the clean up was quick and easy!
Once ordered they were delivered quickly!
Thank you! Fun Markers for easy Wine Glass designation"
3659469,B00Y3VO332,4,"Second review, markers are great, speedy delivery.  Need to be left alone now! markers are great, speedy delivery"
3659470,B00Y3VO332,1,it said you could use on nonporous surfaces and that is not true! it stains chalk board paint period. One Star
3659471,B00Y3VO332,5,Great product just as expected! Five Stars
3659472,B00Y3VO332,5,"I ordered the set of 8 originally. The colors were bold, easy to clean. Only one issue, the were dripping. So I didn't even have to contact the company. I already had an email from them asking about the product quality. I sent an email telling them my issue. They instantly turned around and sent me the 12 pack at no cost, and had it shipped to me within a couple of days! Wow! It was so great to work with a fantastic company, and I have no issues with these new markers! I am a private music teacher, so I travel with my markers and white board. I teach small classes and private lessons. I also use them at home on my chalkboard calendar. They don't have the awful chemical smell like dry erase markers, and they don't leave a dusty mess like chalk. It's the perfect product! It's easy to just wipe away.  I would definitely recommend these to anyone. They're so versatile. I'm excited to draw window displays for the holidays! I'm even more excited to see what new products this company has coming out! Great product! Even greater company!"
3659473,B00Y3VO332,5,terrific and easy to use Five Stars
3659474,B00Y3VO332,5,Great liquid chalk pens! They hold their shape well over use. Five Stars
3659475,B00Y3VO332,5,Given as a gift and very well-received! Excellent
3659476,B00Y3VO332,5,These are such a great alternative to regular chalk!! No residue and so easy to wipe off if you make a mistake! Love them!
3659477,B00Y3VO332,2,"Very bright colors. Tips chiseled within the first two days of using. Also, if you plan on using on a green classroom chalkboard be careful because a few colors do not erase. Very bright colors. Tips chiseled within the first two ..."
3659478,B00Y3VO332,4,"I bought these to make chalkboard signs for the first day of school. They do leave a bit of a shadow on the chalkboard, but I thought they might and I didn't wash it right away. Using a magic eraser helped some, but I wouldn't recommend using them if you are worried about it staining. but I wouldn't recommend using them if you are worried about it staining"
3659480,B00Y3VO332,4,Markers work great however they do let a lot of ink out while writing and need a few minutes to dry as they smear easily. Markers are about the size of a large highlighter. Lots of chalk markers at craft stores aren't cheap so this was a great deal! Great for price!
3659481,B00Y3VO332,5,Love love these markers like having the shiny options great price recommend purchasing Chalkboard shining markers
3659482,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these!! Would buy again! Five Stars
3659483,B00Y3VO332,5,Worked out great.  Used the markers to write on balloons. Worked out great. Used the markers to write on balloons
3659484,B00Y3VO332,1,Markers would not erase cleanly from chalkboard. Some colors worse than others. Used up six Magic Erasers after damp cloth failed to remove writing and drawings. Boxed them up and ordered real chalk. Not as advertised
3659485,B00Y3VO332,5,"Love these for my glass calendar! Vibrant colors and cleaning my calendar for the next month only requires a quick wet paper towel!

Amazing customer service!!!! I got a leaky purple marker and they took care of it. Going above and beyond expectations! Will purchase again! Love these for my glass calendar"
3659486,B00Y3VO332,5,my daughter uses these on her mirror in her room to write messages and draw pictures. The colors are very vibrant. my daughter uses these on her mirror in her room ...
3659487,B00Y3VO332,4,"I'm glad I read the box because I almost wrote on my chalkboard with the gold marker!  The gold and silver are not erasable from chalkboards which is a little disappointing, but not a huge deal.  My only real complaint (and the reason these get 4 stars) is that a few of the tips are uneven and cause the marker to be a little streaky when writing.  Other than that, these are very nice, vibrant-colored markers. Great colors, a little streaky"
3659488,B00Y3VO332,1,"Highly disappointed. I bought these CHALK markers to write on chalkboard easels for my brothers wedding. Their colors are purple and gold so I was excited to see that there was gold in this pack. Well, after reading the box it tells you the gold and silver cannot be used on chalkboards, even though they are CHALK markers. I tried a small area with the gold and it is like a sharpie, does not erase. Even the other colors were very difficult to erase and I had to use a magic eraser to clean the boards. So unless you are looking for a permanent chalk, I suggest you do not purchase these. Very dissappointed"
3659489,B00Y3VO332,4,"Some of the colors (blue, purple) don't show up as well as I thought they would on my Detier Calendar Deluxe, but other colors (esp. orange!) are highly visible, so I'm happy. I also like the sharp tips. so I'm happy. I also like the sharp tips"
3659490,B00Y3VO332,2,I didn't realise they were chisel tip and ordered them thinking they were the round tip. I don't like them as much as the rounded tip ones write much better. They will get the job done for now. I don't like them as much as the rounded tip ones write ...
3659492,B00Y3VO332,5,These markets are awesome! Bright true colors and the work very well.  I bought them to write on an old glass window.  The pens stay on until I used windex and baby wipes to wipe them off. It's just what I was looking for because I change the message on the glass window weekly. I am extremely happy with this purchase. These markets are awesome! Bright true colors and the work very well
3659493,B00Y3VO332,5,So much better than regular chalk They work great
3659494,B00Y3VO332,5,"great product ! Kids loves them. They use this markers in the window. Its easy to clean, I use a damp cloth. great product! Kids loves them"
3659495,B00Y3VO332,2,The market tip was too think and made writing and drawing difficult. I wouldn't buy these again. Two Stars
3659496,B00Y3VO332,5,They work great...colors are all bright. Vibrant Colors
3659497,B00Y3VO332,4,Beautiful bright colors.  They are a good variety.  My only complaint is they are a little drippy.  I would still recommend them though.  My daughter loves creating with these markers. Beautiful bright colors
3659498,B00Y3VO332,5,These are my favorite chalk markers. These are truly vibrant colors and it is wonderful for all types of projects. They hold up perfectly! My favorite
3659499,B00Y3VO332,5,They're perfect! At first i thought they were out of ink but then i realized you press and hold them down for a few seconds in order for the chalk ink to come out.  They're perfect! At first i thought they were out of ...
3659500,B00Y3VO332,4,"Received the markers really quickly. I have only tried the purple one so far, but it worked great. Follow the directions to get the ink flowing. It did take about 15 seconds or so for the ink to come down to the tip and then I wrote on glass and it looks great. I look forward to using the other colors. Nice package and markers."
3659501,B00Y3VO332,5,"The markers work very well on my family's stainless steel calendar. Seller emailed some information about them, which was very kind. Fantastic product, service, and experience! Fantastic product, service"
3659502,B00Y3VO332,4,The product works well.  You need to be be careful when you put the lids back on the markers as the inside of the tip can actually damage the marker tip if you aren't careful. But other than that I am 100% satisfied. But other than that I am 100% satisfied.
3659503,B00Y3VO332,5,"The best chalk markers I have ever used.  I love the chisel tip, I also love that they are interchangeable. Chisel tip to round tip. Great product! The markers work just like a marker, but better! Best chalk markers out there!"
3659504,B00Y3VO332,5,These markers are so cool!!!! I am a preschool teacher and we got these for our classroom. we had used adhesive chalkboard paper on our cubbies and then used these markers to decorate them for the new school year. We also used them on our classroom windows and on the mirror in our room. I also went a lil crazy and used them to decorate a ceramic skull for my husband's spanish classroom awesome markers
3659505,B00Y3VO332,5,These work great. So much easier then using normal chalk and dipping the tips in water to get a bright finish. Only thing is that these will leave ghosting marks when you erase them. I used them on homemade chalkboards so reprinting them isn't an issue. Very bright and go on well
3659506,B00Y3VO332,5,These chalk markets come out so bright and vibrant. I love that theybhave reversible tips. Looks fantastic
3659507,B00Y3VO332,5,"Great product, and easy to use. I used them to decorate my daughter's chalkboard for her first day of preschool. Its my new tradition from here on out. It even cleaned easier than they said. All came off with Windex and I didn't have to scrub. My friend used a different brand and it ruined her chalkboard. Great and fun product with wasy clean-up!"
3659509,B00Y3VO332,1,Almost all the chalk in my package came delievered broken in small pieces preventing me from being able to use them. Very disappointed. Chalk broken
3659510,B00Y3VO332,1,"I bought this beautiful little back to school sign for my child.  Thought all the marker colors looked great - took some pictures.  At the end of the day I used a soapy paper towel to remove the ink from the board to put it away for next year - and the ink WILL NOT COME OFF.  Im so disappointed because I even typed in ""erasable chalk markers"" in the search field and this was the FIRST one to pop up and says that it will come off.  Im completely disappointed as I cant use the same sign anymore for the rest of her school years as its sold out. Disappointed"
3659511,B00Y3VO332,5,Great product!  Highly recommend! Five Stars
3659512,B00Y3VO332,5,"Really like these markers. The tips are nice, in that you can have bold or slim lines. I was playing with them drawing on the back door glass. I was having too much fun! Reminded me of my childhood...lol. I bought these for chalkboard labels for a magnetic spice rack. I am very pleased! Really like these markers"
3659513,B00Y3VO332,4,They seem to work fine when used as the directions state.  My Daughter has fun drawing pictures with them on her chalk board. They work fine
3659514,B00Y3VO332,5,These markers are truly amazing the colors are vibrant and easy to write with Five Stars
3659515,B00Y3VO332,5,I have tried a couple of other brands and these are by far the best. The ink flows easily and smoothly and the lines are thin enough to read. As a previous reviewer commented the gold and silver can leave a shadow but the company explains this in the accompanying instructions. I use these a lot for labelling all my various fermentation bottles and it makes it so easy. Best of any brand that I tried
3659516,B00Y3VO332,5,Awesome for chalkboard design for my daughter's first birthday board! Five Stars
3659517,B00Y3VO332,5,Great product!!! Colors are so vibrant and it writes very smooth. Love that there are two types of tips and more colors included in this set! Great product!
3659518,B00Y3VO332,4,Beautiful colors but if you don't put the cap on just right you'll mess up the tips Nice markers
3659519,B00Y3VO332,4,Not all colors wiped off as easily as I felt the directions led on (this isn't including the gold and silver since directions are different). Love the switchable tips and color vibrancy. Not all colors wiped off as easily as I felt the directions led on (this isn't ...

3659522,B00Y3VO332,5,Love the product! The colors are vibrant and hold up well. Transaction was smooth- I'm a happy customer! Thanks! Great set of chalkboard markers!
3659523,B00Y3VO332,1,You can't wipe off the chalk.  They're a little more permanent that we believed from reading the online description. You can't wipe off the chalk. They're a little ...
3659524,B00Y3VO332,5,Great item. Five Stars
3659525,B00Y3VO332,5,"I bought these for the craft table at my company picnic. I could have expensed it and left the pens at the office, but NO! These markers are fun, so I kept them! These markers are fun, so I kept them"
3659526,B00Y3VO332,5,The best chalk markers products I have ever used. Loved these works wonderful with my projects. Awesome
3659527,B00Y3VO332,5,"These work great!  The ink takes a little bit of prep to get it to the end but the colors are bold and bright.  There are only 2 drawbacks with this set... the tips on the markers have two options (a regular round tip and a flat edge)... I found that on several of the pins that flat edge just didn't go on very smooth so I flipped them around to the round tip and those work great!  The other thing to note is that the metallic colors left a bit of a residue on my chalkboard so I had to put in a little extra effort to get it off and you can still kind of see where the message was at. Great colors, but the metallic ones leave a little bit of a residue behind."
3659528,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these! Great quality!! Will definitely buy them again Five Stars
3659529,B00Y3VO332,5,Nice assortment of colors.  Easy to use.  Wipe off completely with water. Excellent
3659530,B00Y3VO332,5,Really great markers for our chalk board! We use them just about everyday and they don't wipe off too easily dry but they do wipe off with a wet cloth. The colors are very vibrant and just what we need to attract attention! Great markers!
3659531,B00Y3VO332,5,I love these markers! They work beyond great! Five Stars
3659532,B00Y3VO332,5,"I love the markers! They work great and I love the interchangeable tips for the markers! They allowed me to get the job done that needed to be done. The markers are very vibrant on a chalkboard! See picture for proof (: Very, vibrant high-quality markers!"
3659533,B00Y3VO332,5,Bought these to use on the mirrored closet doors to draw and leave notes. The colors are really vibrant and fun and it easily washes off with a little soap and water. Vibrant markers great for work and play
3659535,B00Y3VO332,5,These markers are very much like a paint pen.  The colors are really beautiful and I love that the tips change for finer work. These markers are very much like a paint pen
3659536,B00Y3VO332,5,I bought these markers to use on a chalkboard calendar made with contact paper. I had a different set of markers first that was blurry and difficult to read so I bought these to see if they would be better. They were so much better!  The colors are intense and the tip is sharp.  Love them! Love these Markers!
3659537,B00Y3VO332,5,"Great chalk markers!! They are easy to use and the colors are bright, plus they come with a silver and gold marker. Arrived pretty quickly and their customer service is just amazing and quick to respond.  I will definitely order these again and recommend them to my friends and family. I love these markers!"
3659538,B00Y3VO332,5,I love using this product! The colors are vibrant! The first time use was easy and it writes with ease :) Easy usage

3659544,B00Y3VO332,5,"I love the variety of colors, they work brilliantly. Five Stars"
3659545,B00Y3VO332,5,I really like these chalk markers!  I have been using them to write inspiring messages on my mirrors and windows.  I haven't tried them on any non porous surfaces yet. Wipes right off with warm water and a little soap sometimes. The colors are beautiful.  The gold and silver are not as shimmery as I expected them to be. I don't like the design of the inside of the caps because its easy to cap the marker and run the edge into the tip.  The ink writes very smoothly. I will seek blami chalk for my future chalk marker purchases. I really like these chalk markers
3659546,B00Y3VO332,5,I purchased these markers to make a back to school sign for my little kindergartener. They worked really well on the black dry erase board I had. I had never used chalk markers before so I was excited to give them a try. They are very easy to use and the colors are so vibrant and really pop against the black. They erase well. I didn't use the gold or silver yet so I'm not sure how easily they erase. I am a Prime member so shipping was super fast. Great product from a great company. Looking forward to using these for more Pinterest ideas. I will try to upload a picture of my sign later. Wow! Love These Markers
3659547,B00Y3VO332,4,"Great Markers

I ordered these to use on spice jar labels. I read some previous reviews that weren't stellar, but I have to say, they work very well.  The beveled tip is the one to use for small writing. I figured that out quickly.  The extra instructions and the email from the seller clarifying that non-porous surfaces achieve the best results was a great bonus.  I would order these again. Great Markers"
3659548,B00Y3VO332,4,"there was one color-orange that is somewhat watery and smears when applied. perhaps you could improve that one color. it's a highly desired color for our firm. Also the silver and gold- to improve its eraserability would be greatly appreciated. The orange barely has any color-looks more like a faded watercolor. Thank you. With our artist, your colors will be greatly used on a daily basis to promote our new patients registrations noteworthiness. The orange barely has any color-looks more like a faded watercolor"
3659549,B00Y3VO332,5,Great price compared to most other packs of chalk markers. Seem to be great quality so far and the box even included extra tips just in case any need replaced after some use. Thanks! Great price compared to most other packs of chalk markers
3659550,B00Y3VO332,5,"The marker's colors are bright and vibrant, smooth writing, and I love that the tips are interchangeable from bullet to chisel tip. All around a great buy! and I love that the tips are interchangeable from bullet to chisel ..."
3659551,B00Y3VO332,5,Love the vibrant colors. Just what I was looking for. Excellent price and including a gold and silver in the box. Vibrant colors. Love it!!!
3659552,B00Y3VO332,4,"Love these markers!  I have used them on chalk board and glass.  They are bright and most of the time they do not even need be retraced to be seen.  They wipe off easily from chalk board, but certain colors sometimes need a little more work to completely remove.  On glass, they wipe off completely with barely any effort.  I used the gold marker on glass. Once it dried, the color looked more brown than gold. My orange was very watered down and did not work - probably just a random defect since the others had no issues.  Also, make sure to follow the directions on the box when recapping them or the marker tip could easily be damaged. Eye Catching Color"
3659553,B00Y3VO332,5,They worked fantastically!! I made my daughters back to s hook board with them. Awesome chalk markers
3659554,B00Y3VO332,2,The tip on every marker had pieces hanging off of them so none of them wrote precisely. I wish I had checked the tips thorougly before ruining a project I had been working on for over a week. The tip on every marker had pieces hanging off of ...
3659555,B00Y3VO332,5,"I love these chalk markers! They are just fantastic. The colors are very bright and opaque- they stand out a ton on glass and smooth finishes like a dry erase board or lamination.  They apply easily. Just press the tip on a hard surface until you see the pigment absorb into the felt tip.

 Even though it's called a chalk marker I don't recommend using it on actual chalkboard or chalk paint since those surfaces are porous and they will absorb the pigment and won't erase. I also love the color selection. There are bright colors but they also carry neutrals and metallics which is rare for chalk marker sets that usually just have bright or neon colors. I love decorating our mirrors and Windows for the seasons and holidays and having a wide range of colors is perfect for stuff like Thanksgiving and Halloween.  Erasing is very easy. I just use a disposable wipe and I dry with a paper towel. After a quick wipe and dry the glass is good as new!

I got this as part of a promo so I could share my thoughts with you.  Hope it helped! Great for windows and frames!"

3659559,B00Y3VO332,5,Best liquid chalk markers period. I use them at my work on a weekly basis and they are swesome. Very vibrant colors too. Best liquid chalk markers period
3659560,B00Y3VO332,5,Works wonderfully on my chalkboard but they do not wash off. I did leave them on for several weeks and ended up having to pain over the boards. But were bright colors and seems to be long lasting. Works wonderfully on my chalkboard but they do not wash off

3659568,B00Y3VO332,4,"I love these markers, and the dual tips. The only downside is the blue is like a slate blue, light and kinda grey or ashy. And DO NOT use the silver or gold on anything hope to have it wash off of! They are essentially permanant! Great chalk markers!"
3659569,B00Y3VO332,4,"A wonderful way to use chalk in the crafting and signage craze. Once activated, the colors and liquid chalk flow smoothly. Do read the instructions and make sure your ""chalk board"" is not a porous surface, it will leave shadowing when erasing and will require a little extra work to clean.
My only reason for four stars rather than five is that it takes a bit of work to initiate the chalk flowing in the beginning. You activate it by pressing repeatedly the chisel tip which retracts into the barrel until the liquid chalk flows.

All in all, great product! An easy way to make a big impact!"
3659571,B00Y3VO332,5,Love the product!  Was shipped fast! Five Stars
3659572,B00Y3VO332,4,The silver color does not wipe off very well. Most colors will come off with some windex-type solution and a paper towel. I don't recommend using the silver color at all. Don't use silver. Others colors are fine.
3659573,B00Y3VO332,5,Great chalk pens! And they even have silver and gold:) I used them on my wedding signs and loved them! Amazing chalk!
3659574,B00Y3VO332,1,I am SO upset!! I used these on various chalkboards and they stained every single one.  Good for glass I guess but grossly falsely advertised as these will permanently RUIN any chalkboard!!! AVOID!!! (And you could use a cheap dry erase/ wet erase marker on glass anyway) Will RUIN chalkboards!!!!
3659575,B00Y3VO332,5,Great product. Love the colors! Five Stars
3659576,B00Y3VO332,5,great product and a great price! the markers are true to color and go on easily. love the reversible tips and they include 2 extra tips so it's nice having a back up if you need it. definitely will buy again...and you should too!  great product and a great price

3659584,B00Y3VO332,2,"Everything got here on time, and love all of the colors. However, I'm wondering if these markers are old, as the white and blue markers are already drying out after two uses each, on a medium size chalk board. I always read reviews before I purchase anything, and there were great reviews. Maybe I just got a bad batch of markers? and love all of the colors"
3659585,B00Y3VO332,5,Thank you for your lovely product. Five Stars
3659586,B00Y3VO332,5,"I purchased these to use on a magnetic dry erase weekly menu board.  The board is black, so I was a little worried that the colors (aside from white) would not show up on the board.  I was pleasantly surprised that they showed up true to color, even on a black board.  They erase easily; I used some Windex and a paper towel.  I'm very happy with this purchase. They erase easily; I used some Windex and a paper towel"
3659587,B00Y3VO332,5,These chalk markers work Great on smooth rocks. Have to seal afterwards with an acrylic gloss. Colors are vibrant and fun. Works on rocks

3659591,B00Y3VO332,5,"We purchased several glass boards over white boards and struggled to find a suitable marker for this board.  After trying 3-4 different brands/ types of dry erase markers and several liquid chalk markers, Blami worked the best!!!  I will call the glass board manufacturer to let them know too!  I followed their recommendations for others but Blami worked the best.  I was looking for a marker that would wipe with dry erase eraser and did not require moisture and paper towels for clean up. Blami was right- gold and silver do require moisture, but they stated that up front.

We found our preferred marker set!!!  Thanks!!!

Mark NC Finally! I chalk marker set that wipes with dry eraser!!"

I love the colors. They are bright and not blah. They have interchangeable tips which is nice for labels or signs. They are smooth to write with and produce a great product. These are some of the best ones I have tried. They come with directions, read them. They take a little bit for them to start  writing. Store them laying down flat instead of up and down so the ink will not flow into the tips and ruin your project.  My youngest son loves these too and I am constantly having to hunt them down in his room. I would highly recommend these as an essential part of any crafters good to items.

I received a discounted price in exchange for an honest review GREAT markers"

3659598,B00Y3VO332,2,I got these because they were rated really well. They were horrible. I use chalk markers all the time and 5 out of the 7 I tried were streaky and not opaque. I don't know if I got a bad batch or what. I tried changing the tips with the two replacement tips they sent and they were still streaky and horrible. Not worth the money in my opinion. They were horrible. I use chalk markers all the time and ...
3659599,B00Y3VO332,2,"It's been about six months now and these markers may soon need to be replaced...and they aren't even used very much!  We have a glass bulletin board.  The marker tips are starting to ""bend"" and lose their shape, and the ink doesn't work very well when the marker is used in a vertical position (on the wall).

I think I'll look for another brand next time :( not great :("
3659600,B00Y3VO332,5,I love the colors and the use of it. I basically bought it to write on my chalk cap but now I'm using it to take notes on my mirror and I love it ! The quality is good and I definitely recommend it :) Good quality product

3659604,B00Y3VO332,5,"This is a new company, just starting out, and they seem to ACTUALLY care, when it comes to what their customer base thinks of their products. I have now gotten to try out the markers, and they are some of the better chalk markers I've used. They are quite well formulated, so it would seem, as typically I'd have a dry one by now with most other brands I've tried. These write with excellent fluidity, and the colors are brilliant, and really pop off my blackboard....(it is black, not green) And their customer service team is awesome! Not that i had any issues, they actually contacted me a few days after i received the package just to see how i was liking them! That to me says, ""we have a quality product, and we'll prove it."" Thank you Blami! Awesome markers, awesome staff, Great shopping experience!"

3659618,B00Y3VO332,4,"Great price for good quality chalk markers. My only complaint is that the gold marker looked more like brown when dry. You have to be careful putting the lids back on or the tips get bent, but it did mention that on the box. Nice bright colors! Great price for good quality chalk markers"
3659619,B00Y3VO332,1,They do not erase! Messed up my chalk board Do not buy!
3659621,B00Y3VO332,5,"Update: Within an hour of posting an initially negative review, I was contacted by a professional and polite customer service rep. She offered to send me out a new set of markers to replace the defective ones. I was quite impressed with the level of professionalism exhibited by this company.

Manufacturing errors can occur, but making sure that a customer is happy? That's the perfect situation!

They did kindly note to me that the markers are not intended specifically for walls which have chalkboard paint on them. However, some of the rest of the pack of markers did work and worked well on the painted wall surface. In addition, my eldest daughter appropriated the black chalk marker for her bedroom mirror and really likes it.

The price is right, and the service even better. I imagine I will be buying these again real soon. I have a lot of homeschooling to do in the fall, and plenty of story writing this summer! Excellent customer service"
3659622,B00Y3VO332,5,The colors are bold and pretty! I was glad to discover I could use them on a white board too. I really like them and totally recommend them Bold colors

3659639,B00Y3VO332,4,"These markers were purchased to use with black ""chalkboard"" paper that I put up in my kitchen to display my meals for the week and recipes to try. Most of the colors are very rich and vibrant. The exceptions would be the gold and silver (slightly disappointing) and also the purple. These colors come off a little more translucent than opaque like the other colors. All of the colors are a little hard to clear from the paper, and become more difficult to remove the longer they're up.

Despite the few flaws...I'd definitely recommend them. These colors come off a little more translucent than opaque like the other colors"
3659640,B00Y3VO332,1,"There is no way to draw a fine line.  Im going to have to order ones with finer tips.  I figured with this set I could have my cake and eat it too, but that's not the case.  When you start to use them it seems as if you waste a lot of the chalk marker ink when peeping and if you get any of the chalk pain on you and I MEAN ANY CHALK Ink it will transfer to whatever you touch,  clothes, tape, food,  skin, etc.  It's totally out of control on how slow it tried and ow easy it smears and runs!!  Very disappointed after all the reviews I read by before picking a set Don't BOTHER BUYING!!  Seriously, they bleed all over everything and doesn't do what they advertise!!!!"

3659658,B00Y3VO332,4,"Not what I thought they were; I already have permanent chalk markers that work just like a real marker.  These need to have the tip pressed and primed before use.  Also have to shake them a lot.  One of my colors won't work at the tip (so I can't get a fine-point usage out of it), and some work wonderfully.

Not a bad product at all, I like all the colors and they show up great on a black background.  Just not quite the fine point that I was going for, and having to shake the markers every so often gets annoying. I already have permanent chalk markers that work just like a real marker"

3659667,B00Y3VO332,5,"So vibrant, and not messy. I love them. When I first received, I wrote all over my chalkboard with the gold marker before reading the instructions that gold and silver may become permanent on porous surfaces such as chalkboards. I was able to remove all traces with a goo removing cleaner (goo gone, goof off, etc). Problem solved!  Hope that helps others like me who are so excited for the metallic markers that they don't read the box and then freak out when it doesn't wash off. I love them. When I first received"

3659672,B00Y3VO332,5,"This liquid chalk markers are slick and work great. I love being able to pick different colors that look great on my chalkboard I use in the house. These work so much better than your typical chalk. They go on smoothly onto the chalk boards and make your writing look nice and neat. I love that this pack came with two extra liquid markers. Adding gold and silver into pack makes it fun to add some accent colors. You can also use these liquid chalk markers for scrap booking as well. I like to sometimes make my own birthday cards for people and these markers I used on paper and they work slick and give the cards and different fun look to them. The website you can also use this on porcelain, glass windows, mirrors, plastic bags and much more. I would love to try to use these on mirrors and glass windows during the holidays to make some seasonal art. Knowing that these markers are versatile is so fun!. These markers are easy to clean on a chalk board and if you get the cloth damp after you erase your art or writing the area becomes nice and clean again with no streaks. This product came on time and exactly as it was pictured on the website. I would recommend these fun chalk markers to anyone who loves to do artwork or just to someone who is looking to add some color to their chalk boards. Fun colors!"

3659677,B00Y3VO332,1,"It should be stated more clearly that, unless you are using these on a specific type of surface, they are NOT erasable.  I tried to wipe this off immediately after using it and it would not come off.  Extremely disappointed. Extremely disappointed."
3659678,B00Y3VO332,5,"First off I received these chalk markers for free for providing  a review.  With that being said these markers are great!  We have a family room ottoman that has a wooden cover.  We used chalk board paint and painted it.  It is now our living room graffiti  board.  These markers are very bright and look great.  I attached a picture after family game night (we played yahtzee while drawing it was a lot of fun).

The downside to these markers in my application (chalkboard paint) was they did not wash off completely.  They fade to very very dim but the undertone is still there.  However the packaging clearly marks to use them on a less porous surface which painted on chalk board paint is not.  The other thing you have to be careful of is when putting the lids back on you can damage the tips of the marker if you do not push them in 100% straight.  This is not an issue for my spouse and I but for my kids we had to remind them.  Blaml does however ship with 2 replacement tips so its a win!

These markers are very bright and are really fun to play with.  I highly recommend them! Great vibrant chalk markers!"
3659679,B00Y3VO332,2,"I loved these markers at first because they were so vibrant and perfect for our new chalk board calendar. Sadly after the second use, many of the colors are coming out faded and watery despite storing them horizontally as recommended, and shaking well before use (or even if I don't shake before using, I can't win). This has happened with green, red, orange, and pink so far. Somehow the light blue still holds its opacity with each use. Such a bummer.
My photo shows ""yoga noon"" written two different times both with the pink marker. Colors get watery and faded"
3659680,B00Y3VO332,5,Excellent Product! The colors look just as fantastic on a whiteboard as they do on a chalkboard! Thanks Blami! Excellent Product!
3659681,B00Y3VO332,5,I have quite a few sets of chalk markers. Not a day goes by that I don't use my markers! Yours are great. Thank you Great!
3659682,B00Y3VO332,5,"How much do I love these Blami Chalk Markers?  Let me count the ways!
I love the colors, bright, bold and clear.  The gold, silver and copper are extra special nice!  A nice spectrum of colors.
I love how they feel in my hand, the markers aren't too big or too small, just right for Mama Bear!
I love how you can pull the tip out and reverse it so you can use either the chisel tip or the bullet tip, just use something to protect your fingers from getting messy if you care about that!
I love that you can actually blend the colors, I'm stoked!
I love the metallic colors, gold, silver and copper.  I know I mentioned it already, but I really like them, a lot!

Thank you Blami Arts for the opportunity to review your chalk markers for a lightning deal on the price, they are wonderful! These are the best chalk markers, ever!"
3659683,B00Y3VO332,5,"I recently purchased a couple rolls of black chalkboard contact paper to upcycle a few frames that I found while I was out thrift shopping. I turned an old picture collage frame into a chalkboard and made it the centerpiece of my kitchen wall.

I was so excited when these liquid chalk markers arrived! I immediately begin drawing on my new chalkboard. The instructions on how to use these markers are very clear, and I had no problem getting them started. Make sure to follow the instructions and only use these liquid chalk markers on nonporous surfaces. I understand that the gold and silver markers might be a little harder to remove on some surfaces, but I didn't too much worry about that when I drew on my chalkboard because I can always put a new piece of chalkboard contact paper over the glass when I want to change the design.

I made a couple mistakes while I was drawing on my chalkboard, but a slightly damp and paper towel took care of that right away. Once the surface was dry, I started right back up again. These markers are awesome!

Discounted sample provided for evaluation. All opinions of this product are my own and my review is honest and completely unbiased. I am really having fun with these markers and I would definitely buy them again. I feel like a kid again!!"
3659684,B00Y3VO332,5,Now these are awesome colors and fun to use. Have to read the directions first chalk pens

Hard to tell what will be in good shape versus what will be prematurely dried out.

Imagine you'll only get 3-4 of the colors in the pack to work, but they'll work very well. If the economics of that deal work for you, buy these.

Updated review 4/2016:
The ones I've used have been great shots of color. My original review was titled, ""Can you justify this price based on only 3-4 working markers?""

Blami reached out to me proactively to replace the markers - unexpected, appreciated and deserves at the very least an extra star. I haven't had as much use for the markers since they've been replaced (I had had a time sensitive project) so I can't say if the quality is better. But I can say that their proactive approach to customer service means I'll definitely turn to Blami first when I need markers etc. Excellent Customer Service"
3659686,B00Y3VO332,2,"These markers have great color when written, however they ruined several of my purchased chalkboard easels/boards as they do no erase all of the way...or on one easel not at all. Maybe these work well on a true chalkboard, but the decorative things bought at Michaels/Target that a chalkboard in appearance not so much. Disappointed :-( Do Not Erase Well"
3659687,B00Y3VO332,5,Great Item & seller Five Stars
3659688,B00Y3VO332,5,Great service. Excellent quality product! Writes smoothly and the color is bold and opaque. Great chalk markers!
3659689,B00Y3VO332,5,Great Markers! The colors are very bold. Five Stars
3659690,B00Y3VO332,5,"These markers are amazing!  AND, the seller contacted me MULTIPLE times to make sure that I was happy with my purchase.  The colors are bright and I love the dual changeable tips!  We did have some trouble removing the chalk ink from one of our chalk boards, but I think that was from the board, not the marker.  I'm very impressed, especially with the customer service.  OH, and also, the instruction were very nice, there were very clean instructions on the best way to get the chalk ink to start flowing! THank you! These markers are amazing! AND so is the customer service!"
3659691,B00Y3VO332,2,"Markers are not the quality I expected.  They are very runny when applying, take too long to dry, and when dry become slightly translucent instead of opaque.  Work just fine for simple letters or numbers on a board but not much else. Usable and thats about it."
3659692,B00Y3VO332,4,"I was specifically looking for markers that were fine point, so I could write in my normal handwriting size. I can not do that with the ""chisel fine tip"" of this marker. I have to write at least twice as big as my normal lettering, and anything smaller than that blends together. Other than that, the directions for first time use were clear, the colors are vibrant, it wipes off easily, and I am happy with the purchase. If they offered a REAL fine tip marker (more like a pen tip) I would definitely be interested in purchasing! Impressed, especially for the price."
3659693,B00Y3VO332,5,Great quality pens.  They flow easily after following instructions on how to use them for the first time and the colors are pretty and vibrant.  I really like the gold and silver pens that were also included in the set. Great quality pens
3659694,B00Y3VO332,5,"These are great! My kids have loved writing with them, as have I. I purchased them with chalkboard Mason jar labels for Valentine's Day cards and they turned out very cute! Love the bright colors. The red is the only color that didn't show up as bold and bright on black. I would gather that it would be darling on white though. These are great! My kids have loved writing with them"
3659695,B00Y3VO332,5,"These arrived quickly and on time. I was super happy with them as they had a wide range of colors that I needed for my chalkboard art! They were a bit thicker than I thought they would be, but one side of the tips allows for a finer point. Def a good buy! Great Chalk Markers"
3659696,B00Y3VO332,1,These marker will not come off. I strongly do not recommend and would have to say that they don't even deserve one star. Because of these markers I have to repaint over them in order to get it covered completely. Definitely do not buy unless you want a huge waste of money and time! 0/5 stars !
3659697,B00Y3VO332,2,I bought these for chalk boards I have at work for my employees to motivate them through out the week. I love the colors nice and vivid. the reason I am giving them a low rating is because they do not come off very well.  I have several chalk boards throughout the office some get changed daily others weekly.  The ones that are changed weekly take a lot of scrubbing to get off what is written the ones change daily still show a little residue left over unless cleaned with a liquid cleaner.  I have also used these at my home where I have a wall that has been painted chalk board it does not come off I had too add another layer of paint.  ;( I love the colors nice and vivid
3659698,B00Y3VO332,5,"lovely chalk markers.  they write very smoothly.  i have no issues trying to remove the marks later on.  bold colors, not runny. lovely chalk markers. they write very smoothly. i ..."
3659699,B00Y3VO332,5,"As a bar manager, I have gone through several chalk markers. I am very happy with this purchase. The selection of colors as well as the value exceeds all of the other markers I've purchased. I can't speak for the longevity yet, but the ink runs smoothly and the colors are vibrant. Great product"
3659701,B00Y3VO332,4,"I do a lot of art with chalk for my kid's chalk wall in their play room, when I seen these I had to give them a try. I absolutely hate the feeling of chalk and I know it may sound weird, but I wear gloves when I use regular chalk. I went to work as soon as I received these and I have to say I am quite happy with them. I mainly used them for outline purposes, words and details. I like the fact they do not wipe off very easy. With a 3 yo running around most of my pictures are ruined within minutes. Saying that, you will have to put some muscle into getting the chalk off or use a damp cloth. All the color are great except the gold. This is why I couldn't give it 5 stars. The gold is so watery that it takes forever to dry and after the first use it No longer looks gold it looks more like a mustard color. Maybe I just received a bad one and you can for yourself in the photo I attached( gold is right above the yellow). Overall these are great. I really like them, so much I purchased another set for the kids. I absolutely hate the feeling of chalk and I know it may ..."
3659702,B00Y3VO332,5,This is a fantastic set.  They work exactly like paint pens except once you let them dry they can be removed.  I was not able to simply brush off the chalk color and did have to use water but that added step was not too much to ask.  I did receive this product with a discount from the seller in return for honest and unbiased feedback on the product. Great Set.  Many colors
3659703,B00Y3VO332,5,"Works great, pretty colors and great customer service yesss"
3659704,B00Y3VO332,5,Great but doesn't work on Chalkboard painted wall! Five Stars
3659705,B00Y3VO332,5,Just got my markers in and they are awesome!!! The gold and silver turned out better than what I was expecting. awesome
3659706,B00Y3VO332,5,Already put them to use and I love them!!! Tip just press down and watch the paint come down to the tip then just create your magic! Already put them to use and I love them!
3659707,B00Y3VO332,5,I selected this product since it featured metallic gold and silver markers. Definately not dissapointed! The colors are bright and crisp. They actually wash off easier than regular chalk and are a lot of fun to use! I've been using them on chalkboards around the house but think they would be perfect for the chalkboard wine glasses and serving wear I've been seeing at places like Pier One. Love them!
3659708,B00Y3VO332,5,"These markers are great for writing on non-porous surfaces, and they're fun to use. Ive been having fun scribbling little pictures on mirrors. The colors are very vivid.

Instructions on how to use these markers are on the box. The company also includes two extra tips, in case one of the tips breaks. I accidentally broke (or rather, frayed) the tip to my black marker, but I actually haven't needed to change it yet. The tips are very thick and rigid, so a minor break to the side edge of the tip hasn't hurt the markers performance at all.

These markers do not take long to dry; drying time depends on how much you use. A very thin line or layer dries almost immediately. A thick layer may take 30 seconds or so, but it hasn't taken longer than that for me. The non-metallic colors erase easily with a dry napkin or cloth; the gold and silver markers need a wet napkin/cloth, but then they also come off easily.

Each of the markers caps denotes the markers color. The only downside for me, due to my not-great eyesight, was that I thought the gold cap was a greenish color, and I thought the brown cap was bronze-gold. Once I actually used them, though, the colors were vivid and clear; it was obvious which was which. All the other colors were well-represented by their caps.

Also something to be aware of: The inside of the caps have a groove in which to insert the tip of the marker (see photo). Missing this groove is how I frayed the side of my black marker tip. As I said before, the tips seem pretty strong, so a minor fray or break doesnt affect how the marker works. Still, its something to know.

I received this item at a discount in exchange for an honest, unbiased review. These markers are great for kids and adults alike. They are a fun, easy way to perk up your day. Bright and fun to use"
3659710,B00Y3VO332,5,"I sure wish I had found these before Christmas! I purchased some chalkboard type labels for some gifts I was making and the included marker did not write fine enough for the small labels. I bought another marker that supposedly was fine, but alas, it was worse than the first marker. I purchased these with a promotional discount in order to evaluate, and I absolutely love, love, love them!! I don't have the prettiest or fanciest handwriting but I couldn't wait to try these out. I made the sign below on a glassed frame, using several of the colors, and you can see how vibrant they are. There were so many colors that it was hard to choose. You do need to push down on the tip the first time they are used in order to get the ink flowing to the tip.

It was also very easy to get that fine line I was looking for and they worked great on my small labels. It was easy to rub off the marker within the first five minutes or so, but after that it took a damp cloth to remove the writing. I really like the fact that the marker does not come off very easily once completely dry. The first markers I bought would come off if you just picked up the jar and I found that I needed to spray the labels with Fixatif in order to keep that from happening (which makes it permanent and that's not always what I want).

I have started using my leftover labels on spice jars now since the holidays are over - and it's fun having all the color choices. I like that I can change what's on the labels if I want to use the jar for something else. I feel like a little kid with these and am excited to try these out on more fun stuff! Hope this was helpful :) Vibrant colored chalk markers - so many uses!"
3659711,B00Y3VO332,5,"I have a serious fascination with chalk markers.  I love bring able to write on black chalkboard surfaces in bright colors that look like chalk.  The metalic colors were not quite the same viscosity as other chalk markers I have used but work well and are beautiful colors.  This is a great set with unusual colors, I think my favorite is non pink!

These are great for our meal plan white board, a chalkboard (vinyl) wall calendar, chalkboard labels for glassware and do much more. Beautiful color choices"
3659712,B00Y3VO332,1,Unhappy. Silver and gold don't come off the board all the way. Leave streaks One Star
3659714,B00Y3VO332,5,Buy this set of liquid chalk markers because it has the gold and silver markers.  You will be glad you have those colors. Perfect set with Gold and Silver
3659715,B00Y3VO332,2,"7 of the colors work great, but the other 5 RUINED my daughters chalkboard. The light colors: Silver, gold, white, yellow,  and light blue did not/will not come off her chalkboard.  We tried every method possible with no results. Heck, these 5 colors are more permanent than most permanent markers I've used!!!
We used them together on Christmas day shortly after she opened them and just before bed she tried to erase the board and the 5 colors I listed did not come off. Yes, im sure she did not use anything but these chalk markers because 1. We drew together and 2. We don't have any other chalk or markers.
A real disappointment because now I need to replace the entire chalkboard, which takes up one entire wall..... I have to spend about $60 because of these ""chalk"" markers. I'm giving two stars instead of one because they do write smoothly and the colors are vibrant, but what's the point if they don't come off?# Ruined the chalkboard - some colors will NOT come off"
3659716,B00Y3VO332,5,We love the markers and they were a great price.  The colors are so vibrant!!  They were shipped quickly as well.  I would definitely recommend the markers and the vendor! We love the markers and they were a great price
3659717,B00Y3VO332,5,"The pens are great, work well and are easy to use (follow the instructions the first time). I've used them on plexiglass (used instead of whiteboard) against a dark wall, where they show up clearly. The markers erase with a simple felt eraser (used on chalkboards), or completely with a damp cloth.  Highly recommend! I also purchased a set of white markers, which also work well, but the colors give routine duties some fun.

All that said, I would take care as to what you use the metallic markers on. While they did not stain the plexiglass, it was difficult to remove the color from the rag I used to wipe it later. Great!"
3659718,B00Y3VO332,5,Thank you! We love the markers! I wish all businesses were as helpful and professional as you! We love the markers
3659719,B00Y3VO332,1,"Sadly I bought these for blackboard use.  DON'T DO IT.  It does NOT come off blackboard.
But the colors are beautiful and true.  Regrettably they are also forever. Do not use on blackboards"
3659720,B00Y3VO332,5,My kids love it..... Five Stars
3659721,B00Y3VO332,5,"I am so excited to receive this order.  Blami Chalk has 12 liquid chalk markers.  I love that fact it included an extra gold and silver marker --- these 2 colors are great to use for the holidays.  I needed these liquid chalk markers to make signs.  Of course, I tested on a white sign board.  I wanted to make sure it is easy to write and, of course, it was.  I followed the instructions on the box.  I have to press down on the tip in order for the tip to fill with ink.  It wrote easily on the white surface.

I followed the box instructions to erase the black writing.  Even though I used a damp towel I can still see the faded black letters on the white surface.  (Look at the photos to see what I mean.) Easy to follow direction and use!"
3659723,B00Y3VO332,5,"These Chalk Markers by Blami are awesome! I really like having a 10 pack of them.so these offer a wider variety of colors and they are super easy to use. They work on any non-porous surface. I use them on the mirror, windows and on my chalkboard labels for my containers. They come with a 6mm reversible tip, so you have your choice of slanted or bullet shaped tips to write with.
They are also water based, so if you get any on your clothing, it will wash out, easily. I definitely recommend these to anyone, you don't have to be crafty to use these. I am so glad I was able to purchase these at a great promotional price, in exchange Great Chalk Marker"

3659725,B00Y3VO332,5,"I loved these Chalk Markers! We used them to decorate the car windows for a sporting event this weekend. They wrote nicely. Later that evening, I cleaned the Windows and the clean up was very easy!!! I highly recommend these. Easy to use!!"
3659726,B00Y3VO332,4,Great!  Even works on hair!  But silver and gold don't work well in general. Great! Even works on hair
3659727,B00Y3VO332,4,"Product works great.  I do caution you to be careful when putting the cap on... if not done right the tip can be damaged.  Note to self... if I had read package, it does say this right on the outside...lol.  Vibrant colors and easy to work with. Great Product"
3659728,B00Y3VO332,5,"These are great chalk markers. The colors are bright, used them with a stencil. Rubbed off mistakes. You get a solid line, better than regular chalk. Looks neat and clean. I may not go back to chalk. Fun colors"
3659729,B00Y3VO332,5,Really nice set of chalk markers with basic colors + silver and gold for the holidays. I used this on a chalkboard label for my laundry detergent. Great color selection
3659730,B00Y3VO332,5,"Totally fun and great quality... for kids and adults  No mess, just fun "
3659731,B00Y3VO332,1,Received the item & some of the pens were clearly used as there was ink already soaked into the tips. The white tip was frayed. I purchased this set mainly because of the included gold marker. The gold marker was awful. It was watery and just looked horrible on the chalkboard Don't buy!
3659732,B00Y3VO332,5,Love these. Exactly what I needed for chalkboard!  Beautiful colors!  Very nice! Five Stars
3659733,B00Y3VO332,4,"I bought these for the lab tables in my classroom. They work great, and kids love using them to diagram different ecology concepts. Great for lab tables in classroom!"

3659736,B00Y3VO332,1,"At first I really like these. Minus the tip which I wasn't very satisfied with. I used them for my calendar to make it more exciting Except for the fact when I went to erase the markers off, it turns out they don't seem to erase very well or even at all!!! That being said my calendar I just bought a month ago is now ruined. Also the pens are now drying up.. and are super watery. I'm expecting a refund after this nonsense. Unbelievable"
3659737,B00Y3VO332,5,Great collection of colors!  Points allow for fine lines as well as thick making signs stand out Eye Catching
3659738,B00Y3VO332,5,"Awesome! Extremely vibrant!! These are my new favorite thing!! I sell my hand crafted jewelry and I have a show coming up the end of the month and thought chalkboard signs would be good attention getters, and now with these babies its a sure hit! Will definitely order again when these are used up!
Tip: wait until dry to wipe off with a dry cloth or else it just smears and is hard to get off chalkboard surface, but a wet cloth will get it off in a flash. sure to grab attention!"
3659739,B00Y3VO332,5,"Hi!
 I'm a very busy girl and that's why I like to keep everything well organized. I came across Blami chalk markers because I was looking for erasable liquid markers with paint that is durable in the freezer. They are great as they help me organize food containers in my freezer.
Last week I didn't have much time for cooking so I decided to take something from the fridge. When I opened it, I was completely lost because I didn't know what was in each plastic container. Self-adhesive stickers have somehow fallen off.
Now I use these chalk ink pens and I don't get frustrated when I have to find certain frozen food. Blami chalk markers have nice, bright colors that stay on plastic even if you put it in the freezer. The best thing about them is that you can simply erase the writing from the container when you have emptied it and you can use it over and over again. That's just perfect.
Blami chalk pens can be also used as glass markers because they are equally efficient on glass, windows, mirror, porcelain and similar surfaces. They are completely erasable and they don't damage the material. I use these chalk pens on different smooth materials in my kitchen and pantry (I labeled different glass and plastic items).
In set of 12 chalk markers are also gold and silver markers. Those two take longer time to remove form plastic or glass as they are actually made for decorations (this is also stated in instructions). So be careful when using gold and silver because if you want to erase them, you have to use them only on glass, plastic and stainless steel. Gold and silver ink is beautiful and very shiny so I will definitely use them for decorating different items at Halloween, Christmas.
I strongly recommend these liquid chalk markers to everyone who loves to keep things organized and have fun decorating their homes, parties
You'll love them! Great for labeling food storage and frozen food"
3659740,B00Y3VO332,5,great chalk markers. colors are vibrant. used on chalkboard. Five Stars
3659741,B00Y3VO332,5,"Super easy to use. Last until you WANT to take the chalk off. Plenty of control, and chalk ink comes out in nice smooth lines. Super easy to use"
3659742,B00Y3VO332,5,"The Blami chalk markers are fantastic! I purchased these to work on banners and other small projects for a friends wedding and these markers are perfect!!! The chalk markers are super easy to use! The pen filled in just 6-8 pumps which is super fast compared to some other chalk marker I've used in the past. The colors are vibrant and beautiful especially the metallic gold and silver markers! They look amazing on the chalkboard banner pieces I purchased at Micheal's and they also look pretty on plain white paper!!!! You can also use them on glass or other non-porous surfaces and they wipe off with no issue. They don't drip, leak or leave behind residue! Clean up is a breeze I just used a damp cloth on the glass and it was nice and clean!!! I highly recommend them! Awesome for crafting"
5326503,B00Y3VO332,5,Nice colors and applies/ writes well Perfect item
5326504,B00Y3VO332,5,"Received my chalk markers and used them for the first time!  They were great, very colorful and bright! Great product"
5326505,B00Y3VO332,5,These chalk markers are really nice. They write well. Delivery was quick. Great product
5326506,B00Y3VO332,5,LOVE LOVE LOVE these chalk markers! They sure came in handy with drawing and decorating rocks for a project of hide and seek! These Markers Rock!!!
5326507,B00Y3VO332,5,"These are amazing, they work better then all the other chalk markers I've used and they come with the eraser and a bunch of super cute labels. Will buy again when I need more! Amazing!"
5326508,B00Y3VO332,5,"The bright colors are amazing , easy to erase just over all great markers ! Perfect markers !"
5326509,B00Y3VO332,5,These markers have come in handy in my classroom.  I have used them for marking so many things.  I would buy them again! Great markers
5326510,B00Y3VO332,5,"This is an awesome product because the colors are vibrant like a real marker and comes with a variety of colors in the package. It easily wipes off with water and a rag.  When it gets dry you just shake it up and push the tip and more ink comes out. When you first open your package, you do have to shake it up a bit (each color) and push the tip down then shake and push the tip again until you see ink soak the white tip with color. There are 2 tips you can use, a round tip and marker like tip (not sure of the name maybe broad marker tip), we prefer the round tip.  My kids use this often and you can imagine the abuse it gets - and we still are using it. It isn't used daily, more like weekly and when the one day they have interest to draw on their chalkboard (the adhere to wall type also purchased on amazon), they draw for hours.

I purchased this to have a impermanent mark on their magnetic chalkboard so that I could write what they've learned or need to learn on it without being erased easily by them.  But then they started getting creative and just drawing with hem and the board is no longer used for school. hahahaa.  All in all, id buy this brand and product again. BRIGHT. THICK TIP. WIPES OFF WITH WATER"
5326511,B00Y3VO332,5,I absolutely love these markers.  They write so smoothly and have bold bright colors which show up nicely on dark backgrounds.  No dragging or skipping. Bright Bold Color
5326512,B00Y3VO332,4,I love the bright colors and the ease of use. I don't like that the gold and silver do not erase. Good value for the money
