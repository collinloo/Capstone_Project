2631800,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Cool gel pens! When they run out of ink or dry out I recycle them.  All pens , makrers, and mechanical pencils are recyclable if they break. I just throw the whole thing in the recycling because they can grind up the plastic and magnetically separate the metal particles. Better for the earth.
 Cool gel pens"
2631801,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Some of the pens don't write very well, but it is a good set to have on hand Decent for price"
2631802,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great pens, great price! I'm set for coloring. Five Stars"
2631804,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love the color variety! Better value in getting these then regular 12 count packs. Color variety!
2631805,B00CRQL8OW,5,"for the price......i expected the colors to be pretty dull, but to my surprise they are actually very vibrant. The metallics are nice too they actually have very nice shades. The pens themselves have a nice smooth drawing action as well, some cheap gel pens can be very spotty and scratchy when you write or draw with them. Also the glitter colors lay pretty well on paper/cardstock too, unfortunatley as with all gel pens that are metallic the sheen tends to rub off on your hands i have found that happens to every metallic pen out there, maybe a spray fixative that you use with pastels may stop that from happening but i haven't tried that yet. All in all they really are better than i expected them to be. better than expected"
2631806,B00CRQL8OW,5,Very good. Five Stars
2631807,B00CRQL8OW,4,Only issue i had was that the box was broken and some pens didn't have caps. Other than that great colors! Other than that great colors!
2631808,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great for coloring! Beautiful variety of colors! Five Stars
2631809,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Some of them are duds and never get a good ink flow but overall, a good purchase -- especially the sparkle and metallic pens. Some of them are duds and never get a good ink flow but overall"
2631810,B00CRQL8OW,4,Pens tend to run out of ink quickly and wish there was more variation in color. Small disappointment
2631811,B00CRQL8OW,1,We tried to use the for coloring but the pen quit working even though there was still ink in it. Very disappointing. We tried to use the for coloring but the pen ...
2631812,B00CRQL8OW,2,When using them on paper they color really nicely but they leak. Them have leaked out. Two Stars
2631813,B00CRQL8OW,5,great variety. smooth writing on most pens in the box. one tray of repeats. great variety
2631815,B00CRQL8OW,2,Received the lolliz gel pens as a gift. When I opened them I found none of the caps were on tightly and a number of them don't write at all. Most of the ones that do write do not write smoothly and skip. I was so disappointed and am sorry that I cant recommend these gel pens. Disappointed
2631816,B00CRQL8OW,1,Not good quality. Wouldnt purchase again. Pens stop working after very little coloring. One Star

2631822,B00CRQL8OW,4,kept it for myself Four Stars
2631823,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love these pens, I use them in school for writing, one thing though is to shake them before using them for the first time so the ink can come down. I also have to shake them every once in a while too but that's no big deal to me Love these pens"
2631824,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Half of these don't work, the ink has either oozed out the back end or separated in the tube. But they're cheap so may still be worth the gamble. Half of these don't work, the ink has either ..."
2631825,B00CRQL8OW,5,I can't believe how wonderful Amazon is and this product. Best deal
2631826,B00CRQL8OW,4,not enough colors...I love the glitter pens I love the glitter
2631827,B00CRQL8OW,1,These pens were not of good quality! Several of them would not even work without applying a little heat to loosen up the ink! Very disappointed! These pens were not of good quality! Several of them would not even work ...

2631829,B00CRQL8OW,5,Beautiful colors.  Smooth ink. Five Stars
2631830,B00CRQL8OW,1,"I was really excited to receive these pens, but they ended up being a disappointment. Most of the pens were full of air bubbles or only had half as much ink as they were supposed to. Some did not write at all, while most would write a sentence and then completely die. Out of 48 pens, maybe 8 or 9 of them were actually useable. But even then, the ink cartridges are so narrow that they are rapidly depleted. I would not recommend. but they ended up being a disappointment. Most of the pens were full of air ..."
2631831,B00CRQL8OW,1,"We bought a pack for a long drive with our kids. Many of them would not work, no matter what we tried. Needless to say, we were disappointed. Many didn't work."
2631832,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great colors Five Stars
2631833,B00CRQL8OW,1,These pens are junk!! They barely have any ink and they make scratch lines on the paper! Its not just one bad pen. All the pens I have tried are junk!! Dont waste your time or money!

2631839,B00CRQL8OW,5,wonderful to use. Five Stars
2631840,B00CRQL8OW,1,I just got these. Half of them don't write. The ink is low on most of them (see picture). Wouldn't buy again!! Low ink in over half the box!!!
2631841,B00CRQL8OW,5,"love them, they are perfect for small spaces in adult coloring books. Super good"
2631842,B00CRQL8OW,5,I love and hate these pens. I love the colors. I hate the ink runs out quicker than I would like and I hate that some of them bleed into the other side. But I do actually like them. Makes it hard to hate them lol I love and hate these pens

2631847,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love love love these. Great set of gel pens. It dries a little slow for some so you can get it on your hands while coloring. I love the assortment of colors. You will be pleased with these. I received mine in a week after ordering. Awesome!! Love love love these
2631848,B00CRQL8OW,1,"Some were dried up, some were half empty and the ink is not lasting as long as the last ones I previously ordered. Very poor quality! Very poor quality"
2631849,B00CRQL8OW,1,The ink doesn't last more than ONE page of writing. All 48 have been thrown in the trash. One Star
2631850,B00CRQL8OW,5,I got these pens for my mom.  She is 95 and needs something to do with her time.  She used these pens until they ran out of ink.  I am getting her another set. Wonderful product
2631851,B00CRQL8OW,1,These pens don't have much ink in them.  They seem to be filled with a lot of air!  I wouldn't buy them again. Filled with air
2631852,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these pens thank you Five Stars
2631856,B00CRQL8OW,1,21 pens out of 48 work. Broken trays and caps and bad ink or dried out ink. Returning. Would not recommend. Only 21 have enough ink.
2631857,B00CRQL8OW,2,So far at least 5 of the pens aren't usable. Very disappointed with the poor quality. Dont buy these pens..
2631858,B00CRQL8OW,1,These suck. Beware these pens. They do not write well and have barely any gel and die easily. They suck.

2631867,B00CRQL8OW,5,A gift for a child. he was very happy
2631868,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great pens. Great price. They write very well. Great price
2631869,B00CRQL8OW,1,These pens are awful.  I drew several short lines with several of them and then they quit working.  I returned them. These pens are awful. I drew several short lines ...
2631870,B00CRQL8OW,5,My daughter is the artist of our family. She has made some really cool drawings with these. The color is so vivid. Only draw back is they don't last for very long. She has made some really cool drawings with these
2631872,B00CRQL8OW,5,Granddaughter loved them Five Stars
2631874,B00CRQL8OW,4,This is a gift so I didn't try all of the colors but 2 I did try were blotting. I hope they all don't blot. Pretty colors and good price I feel for the price. I like that there is a variety. Good price for variety of colors. Hope they all don't blot.
2631875,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Great color selection, too bad they dry out within 10 minutes. I haven't been able to finish coloring a single picture because each time I start one, the pen I am using runs out 1/4 of the way through. Great color selection"
2631876,B00CRQL8OW,5,I like these better than a couple others I have tried.  They are smooth and bright colors. Smooth. Bright colors.
2631878,B00CRQL8OW,4,good pens but seem to leak a little Four Stars
2631879,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love all the colors, works great with coloring books. Five Stars"
2631880,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great pens. Great colors. Color smooth. Five Stars
2631882,B00CRQL8OW,2,"They write super smooth and rich coloring. But one pen may not last a coloring page. It runs out VERY fast! To top it off, the pens are inconsistently filled, some all the way, some half way. My child went through all 48 in a week of daily coloring. Half filled, runs out of ink VERY quickly"
2631883,B00CRQL8OW,2,"There's a variety of fun colors, but most of the pens come with a half or less full of ink. Pens partially filled"
2631884,B00CRQL8OW,1,These were terrible. One Star
2631886,B00CRQL8OW,5,
2631887,B00CRQL8OW,2,Several of the pens do not release the ink without a struggle on my part to get the working.  Some of them scratch up the page I am coloring due to the glitter causing it to look like it got wet and disintegrated.  Several stop working in the middle of coloring and I have to stop and blow hard in the end to get the ink to start working again. Hard to keep working
2631888,B00CRQL8OW,4,Awesome Four Stars
2631889,B00CRQL8OW,5,My daughter loves her gel pens! They work great and have such beautiful vibrant colors Great product

2631892,B00CRQL8OW,4,Great for kids and marking for reading. Four Stars
2631893,B00CRQL8OW,5,Very nice pens! Five Stars
2631894,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great set of pens, especially for the price. The pens write smoothly and don't skip, even when the ink gets pretty low. Great set of pens"
2631895,B00CRQL8OW,2,"The ink smears and leaves globs. The pens stop writing before the ink is gone and you have to scribble around to make them write, which they don't always do. I bought them for coloring and immediately realized they were not good enough for that. Then I used them to grade student papers and they are so inconsistent they really don't work for that, either. The colors are good but the quality of the pens is not. I bought them for coloring and immediately realized they were not good enough for that"
2631896,B00CRQL8OW,4,great deal for the price Four Stars
2631897,B00CRQL8OW,4,Great pens and a variety of colors. All that I don't like it times the caps don't want to stay on at times. I better making of the caps would be better but oh well I'll deal with it. :) Nice pens for all ages. Even adults
2631898,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great for price Five Stars
2631899,B00CRQL8OW,5,Awesome thank you .. Five Stars
2631900,B00CRQL8OW,2,These pens were okay. The ink ran out very quickly and a lot of pens leaked. Some don't write very well either. They're Okay
2631901,B00CRQL8OW,5,love these pens. Nice vibrant colors. members of my coloring group wanted to know where I got them. Five Stars
2631902,B00CRQL8OW,5,Got these as a gift. My sister still has them after a year and still uses them. Really good
2631903,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Came on time, packaged appropriately, and the pens are AWESOME, especially for the price!!! Great deal!"
2631904,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Nice set of pens! I use them to color and write in my planner at work. A few are hard to use because the ink does not flow as nicely or the roller ball tip is a little pointy and makes a groove in my paper. Nice set, good price"
2631905,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I bought these because the price was great (when I ordered one for myself, I paid $5 & change for it. I notice the price increase now, which is the current price. My mother liked them so much that I ordered her one as well, although the price had gone up about $2 (Its still a very reasonable price; these pens are beautiful & there are several diffent types, such as glitter ones, metallic, and I definitely love the swirl onesI didn't have those in my old set. This product is a great one and you cant beat the price! Would definitely purchase again! Awesome!"
2631906,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Omg!!  I'm sooo excited,  my pens arrived in 2 days and I was thrilled to say the least...  I am an avid letter writer and that's what I'm using these pens for *big smiles* ...  The price was amazing too!!  Next payday I will be ordering the 100 pen set by lolliz...  So thank you x100!!! I love these pens ... So amazing !!"
2631907,B00CRQL8OW,5,Bought 2 packages of these and have been using them like crazy! Yes I still love to color even as an adult. I am in love with these! Some of my pictures look so good I want to frame them. These pens are awesome for detailed photo coloring books!! Great purchase!!
2631908,B00CRQL8OW,1,"The pens don't write and the seller doesn't accept returns.  I know they were cheap and didn't expect that they would last very long, but if I can't even use them each once, it's pretty pointless.  Save your money and find something else. Pens don't write"
2631909,B00CRQL8OW,5,Best set of gel pens I've purchased in a awhile!! I will definitely order from LolliZ again. Best Gel Pens!
2631910,B00CRQL8OW,2,"I'm not impressed.  I paid about $15 for these at the time, so I'm not going to completely flame them - after all, you get what you pay for.  Here are my observations:

1) The only pens with decent, consistent ink flow are the Glitter and Metallic pens.  There are lots of these (12 glitter & 11 metallic) so it may be worth the price for these alone... except the metallic doesn't really have a lot of sheen.
2) There are several repeats of colors. I have 3 blacks (1 glitter and 2 identical ""standard"", 1 of which is trying to be passed off as ""metallic"" but it is not metallic) and 3 ""neon/milky"" orange that are virtually identical.  Also are 2 standard blue pens.
3)  The ""swirl"" colors are essentially a gimmick. They do not produce a swirl effect on your paper - they just look cool in the ink cartridge.  Also scratchy/inconsistent ink flow in these.

Overall, I would not recommend this set, and I won't be buying them again.  Even the decent pens in the set doesn't account for the waste of the rest.  Look elsewhere and you can find better.  If you do decide to buy these, don't spend more than $7 for them. Meh verging on Nope"
2631912,B00CRQL8OW,5,These gel pens work great!! They last a long time too! Five Stars
2631913,B00CRQL8OW,2,"ok, so an honest review here (I don't get how there are so many five stare reviews).  First, the pens' barrels are only (and just barely) 2/3s full of ink.  The caps fall off all the time.  Small annoyances but the problem is that a lot of them feel scratchy as in they scratch at the paper instead of flowing ink out smoothly.  Another review mentioned that several of the colors are not much different than the others in their family.  Like two of the greens and two of the reds are almost the exact same color and I found this to be true as well.  I think  there are better choices out there for the same price. scratchy...you can do better"
2631914,B00CRQL8OW,5,I gave this set to a friend who crafts - seriously crafts.  She says they are good and uses them. 'Crafty' friend says they are good
2631915,B00CRQL8OW,4,These pens are very nice. they don't bleed through and are very smooth. Caps fall off very easily though. I would absolutely recommend these gel pens These pens are very nice. they don't bleed through and are very smooth
2631916,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great variety of colors and the pens run pretty smooth. They do not bleed and are very vibrant. Five Stars
2631917,B00CRQL8OW,5,Bought these for a gif t for a 10 year old.  She loved them! Child loved them!
2631918,B00CRQL8OW,5,Smooth application of vibrant colors! Five Stars
2631919,B00CRQL8OW,5,Arrived on time and undamaged.  Tried a few of them so far and love them. Tried a few of them so far and love them.
2631920,B00CRQL8OW,5,I bought this for my wife. So many colors to choose from! Five Stars
2631921,B00CRQL8OW,4,"There great pens. Flow is great, no clogging or drying out. Bright colors love em"
2631923,B00CRQL8OW,5,Beautiful smooth writing pens that don't bleed through easily.  Got them in a Flash Sale!  VERY PLEASED with the price & quality. My favorite gel pens
2631926,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love them !  Great color selection and writes remarkably well! Love them! Great color selection and writes remarkably well
2631927,B00CRQL8OW,4,Great value! Four Stars
2631928,B00CRQL8OW,5,amazing Five Stars
2631929,B00CRQL8OW,5,I read all the reviews on this product and there was a mixture of happy and not. I took the gamble and ordered.  I am very pleased with the product. Great color selection and the pens glide almost effortlessly. Great value and product! Great Product and Value
2631930,B00CRQL8OW,2,"They were okay, but many of them were hard to color with because they weren't smooth.
I had to discard probably 15 of them, maybe more.  Won't buy them again They were okay, but many of them were hard ..."
2631931,B00CRQL8OW,5,Very useful Five Stars
2631932,B00CRQL8OW,4,"i buy gel pens, particularly glitter and metallic, for my bujo so i don't want to pay a lot of money... it's not art; it's just a fun way to stay on track. having said that, these are fine. no problems, but they're not as good as high dollar pens because, well, they're not high dollar. the only thing i've found annoying is that the caps aren't snug enough. they seal, but some come off when jostled. so if get-the-job-done-at-a-low-cost is what you want, these will work. next order, i'll try another, but i might get these again, after seeing how trying another budget set goes... i've had (still have!) worse. okay for my bullet journal"
2631933,B00CRQL8OW,5,nice item Five Stars
2631934,B00CRQL8OW,2,The points of these pens were made in a way that they don't color very smoothly. Two Stars
2631935,B00CRQL8OW,5,Grandson wants me to give to him Perfect
2631937,B00CRQL8OW,5,I  absolutely loved them I absolutely loved
2631938,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love all the options Five Stars
2631939,B00CRQL8OW,4,great purchased 2 sets Four Stars
2631940,B00CRQL8OW,5,Beautiful assortment of colors and fast drying. fast drying and colorful
2631941,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Good gel pens, depending on what you do with them they last quite a while. I use them for color by numbers books and they do tend to run out fairly quickly for that, mainly because those color by numbers books have a lot of detail to them and the one I have is fairly large. I am satisfied with this product and will be purchasing more. Good gel pens"
2631942,B00CRQL8OW,5,Fun! Our teens love to use them to color. Five Stars
2631943,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great colors and variety of ""finish.' Adds that little extra to my ""artwork."" Five Stars"
2631944,B00CRQL8OW,5,Exactly as described and has a good deal of ink in every pen. They write very smoothly and there's not more than one of each color. I like them a lot. Perfect
2631946,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Do not last very long.  Colors are nice and bright/deep but after coloring only three pictures, most are nearly empty.  These were only standard 8.5 x 10 pictures.  Makes them quite expensive. Don't last very long... would not recommend for price reasons."
2631947,B00CRQL8OW,5,Perfect Thank you
2631948,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Quality product. There are a lot of muted tones, which I didn't particularly care for but that's just my preference. They came fast and in perfect condition. Quality product"
2631950,B00CRQL8OW,2,these pens wasn't what I thought. They didn't print or place the ink as well when writing. So I feel I won't use them again. Pens
2631951,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These pens are so bright, and dry right away! I absolutely LOVE them so much that I bought a set for my granddaughter as well. So many different selections to choose from. My mother enjoyed my pens so much while I was visiting her that she too bought a set. Enjoy! FABULOUS PENS"
2631952,B00CRQL8OW,1,Awful writing and coloring quality. Good for one or two words. The pens stop and skip in ink flow. Don't waste your money!
2631954,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Only down side is that they don't last long.  But the ink is fantastic, beautiful and consistent minus the color changing ones - because that is what they are designed to do. I love them!  Great value for great pens! Excellent!"
2631956,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love these pens for my adult coloring book.  Bright colors, some with a glittery look.  Very nice. Love'em"
2631957,B00CRQL8OW,5,Gave as a gift to go with The Psalms in Colour book. Seems to work great. Nice
2631958,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These pens are some of the best I've used as far as vibrancy and control of flow. They came fast and were shipped in excellent condition with no exploded pen barrels and ink all over the place. The reason this is only 4 stars instead of 5 is because the caps are HORRIBLE. They do not stay firmly on the tip, and I am often finding myself fishing for a loose cap or two. I wish the tops had a more firm grip so I wouldn't be afraid of them falling off and drying out my ink, though for the price and the fact I can always revive the ink. I shouldn't have to fish around for the caps is my point. Great, but beware the caps!"
2631959,B00CRQL8OW,4,"This is a review of the ""LolliZ Gel Pens 48 Pen Tray Set""  I have been coloring for a few years.  I am always trying different pens, pencils and markers.  Trying to find my favorites.  I have found that most gel pens are pretty much the same.  Some roll well, some don't.  The inks all seem the same.

This set provides a lot of pens/colors for very little money.  While I found the pens to be nothing special, I appreciate the amount of colors provided.  This set will get you well started for coloring.  I have these pens in my huge collection.  They are back up pens.  If someone is just starting to color, this is a good set.  Lots of variety and they are pretty much like other gel pens.  Even more expensive sets. Lots of Pens for Not So Lots of Money"
2631960,B00CRQL8OW,5,These are awesome!! I didn't even realise that it came with 12 glitter pens and I was very happy when I got it! When you use them it's like your painting with small paint brushes! The only problem is that a couple of the pens didn't work very well but if I shook them or hit them a couple times then they would work again! These are awesome!! I didn't even realise that it came ...
2631961,B00CRQL8OW,4,I never tried these pens before but I got them because of the thousands of reviews. I bought them for highlighting my notes. I wished I had seen beforehand the other LolliZ - 70 pieces for $9.99 though but I don't want to go through the hassle of returning this item. Great pens but you could save more with the 70 piece gel pen set.
2631962,B00CRQL8OW,5,I get these as birthday presents for all my daughters friends. She is 10 & it's always a hit! Five Stars
2631963,B00CRQL8OW,5,These pens work really well.  Better than many other that I have tried. Good quality

2631971,B00CRQL8OW,4,"For $10 you're not getting artist quality but the ink flow is nice, the colors are lovely and you get a bunch of pens.  I use them in a black paper coloring book and the designs really pop.  I particularly like the pastel, neon and the metallic ones Good Ink Flow, a lot of Bang for your Buck"

2631978,B00CRQL8OW,4,Wife loves these. Four Stars
2631979,B00CRQL8OW,4,I haven't used them yet. They look like another pack of pens I bought from here. Probably the same manufacturer. One thing I noticed right away is the blue glitter is low. I know you get what you pay for but if I'm going to buy a pen I would expect it to be filled. Most are uneven which is fine but this one was a bit excessive. Which is why I gave it a four. I don't forsee these being any better than the last pack of a different name and look forward to using them. I use these primarily for writing at work and sharing around the office. Great but...

2631991,B00CRQL8OW,5,I bought these gel pens for my learning disabled child to color with. I tried them out before I gave them to her and thought about ordering a set for myself.

2631998,B00CRQL8OW,1,"The metallic ones color very nice, but there were quite a few of the lighter/neon colored ones that were already dried out, and a couple that dried out after only a few minutes of coloring. A few didn't work."

2632036,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Very Nice Quality Pens - good assortment for the price.  My Dad has taken up coloring - to pass the time in the Nursing Home.  He likes that they are in a nice sturdy case that doesn't tip over, and are easy to get in and out.  Good colors too - on thick paper. Great value"

2632042,B00CRQL8OW,4,You kinda have to break them in first but they are worth the buy Worth it
2632043,B00CRQL8OW,5,"The colors are vivid, and they don't really skip. I would buy from this brand again. Five Stars"
2632046,B00CRQL8OW,4,"This set of 48 gel pens came well packaged and all colors were accounted for. There were a couple that skipped a bit, but at least 75% worked without issue. There is a nice mix of colors. Nice value set"
2632048,B00CRQL8OW,2,Some of the colors act as if they are drying up or already dried up (They don't flow and color as smoothly as the other colors). If it wasn't for that I would definitely give it 5 stars. Some colors don't work right.
2632049,B00CRQL8OW,5,So far so good Lots of colors
2632050,B00CRQL8OW,5,"LOVE THEM !!  What a deal for the buck!  Already enjoying the glittery pens to make decorative invitations for kids parties, etc...  This is a definitely must have!! Bright - Glittery Colors !"
2632051,B00CRQL8OW,4,My sister said these were the best coloring pens she has ever used! Four Stars
2632052,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Not the best gel pens ever, but good enough, at least for my two girls who were quite happy to get these for Christmas. They don't write as smoothly as some, but they're pretty good. Given the number and variety for the price, I'd say it's a great buy--hence the five stars for what may really be more of a 3-4 star product. Just fine--especially for the price"
2632053,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love this set! Great pens, brilliant colors, so many to choose from. Love it. Really good gel pens, great variety"
2632054,B00CRQL8OW,4,These write smoothly and the colors are brilliant.  The only complaint I have is that they don't seem to have as much ink as I'd thought.  A couple of colors have run out after just a few drawings. These write smoothly and the colors are brilliant. The only complaint I have is that they ...
2632055,B00CRQL8OW,5,They draw smoothly and the colors are numerous Five Stars

2632058,B00CRQL8OW,2,Came leaked in the package but they are nice and color nice. Not sure if they normally don't have much ink or if it's from them leaking but the ones I got didn't have enough ink for more than one page of coloring Okay if they don't leak
2632059,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Packaging makes ease of use of the pens cumbersome, you have to pull out the plastic tray and pop out each pen.  Also, in my opinion it's more like a hard ball point pen than a gel pen.  I wouldn't purchase these again. Choose a different brand"
2632060,B00CRQL8OW,2,Too many didn't work at all Not working pens
2632061,B00CRQL8OW,4,They roll on the paper nice.  The one down fall is that if you color a large area with one color you will run out of that color quickly. Nice product
2632062,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great set of pens for my artistic daughter. Wonderful variety of colors. She loves using them, and so do her friends when they come over! Great set of pens for my artistic daughter"
2632063,B00CRQL8OW,5,These bring back memories of my teen years. They are still just as much fun as they were then! Good product
2632064,B00CRQL8OW,5,Colors look great. My cousin loved them. 11/10
2632065,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Test colors first.  Some shades different from tops.  Also, about 20% of pens had unmixed, unmatched ink or would not write and had to be thrown away. Test colors first. Somega shades different from tops. ..."
2632066,B00CRQL8OW,5,Wife loves it. Five Stars
2632067,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great colors and smooth writing Five Stars
2632068,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Nice set and complete, for the price. There is a good cross - section of variety for this set. It is not so big that it is hard to accommodate and not so small that it doesn't offer variety. This is the perfect set for keeping next to the phone so you can complete a project while answering a phone cal!. It has the necessary colors for a joyful coloring experience. You can move them from the box to the drawing and back with relative ease. Most of the pen sets on Amazon are exactly the same 'pens', some have more ink than others but they are the same reciprocal. This is no different, they have the average amount of ink in them and despite other reviews, I haven't found one that doesn't write yet! Sometimes, you can flick a lighter under the bal point and it will warm up the ink enough to get it to start and keep going. I have done that several times! The 'plain' colors are true to the cap color, as are the glitter and, pearlized colors. Once that you have his set, you will be able to decide what else that you my need. I would recommend this set to anyone, unknown buyer or friend. I have NOT been compensated in any way for this review. Excellent & Cheap Complete Set!"
2632069,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Hi quality ink, these pens last a long time.  I bought one for myself and 2 others as gifts.... all are happy ! Great product, great price"

2632082,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great pins; roll so easy on paper! Loll gel pens
2632085,B00CRQL8OW,4,I like these a lot.  They do get jammed up occasionally. I have to bang them and they will unclog.  I wish they would come out with a pack that didn't include the neon as I don't care for those.  But that is just a personal preference.  Also there are some that have multi colored ink in them.  So you don't know what you are going to get until you start using the.  I will likely order more however. Nice for coloring books.
2632086,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These work great, and glide nicely over the pages of my coloring book Five Stars"
2632088,B00CRQL8OW,1,these are super cheap ....ink runs out in day or two and pens break so easily. don't waste your money these are super cheap.
2632090,B00CRQL8OW,5,This a great set of pens. I bought this for a gift with an adult coloring book because I loved mine! They wright very smooth and have great selection of colors. Would recomend!! Love these pens!
2632091,B00CRQL8OW,1,This is terrible I bought it and returned it now it came back home. I'm very disappointed. Hate

2632095,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I absolutely LOVE these pens!! I absolutely cannot go back to color pencils because these pens let out liquid gold! The color range covers basic colors, but with variety of styles (I.e. Metals, Neons, shimmer). Definitely plan to purchase again when I run out of ink! Liquid Gold"
2632096,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I use these to color in my adult coloring books, they work perfect. Will definitely buy more when i run out. Very smooth application"

2632101,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I own half a dozen different brands of gel pens. I always have to buy more because the first colors to run out are the greens and the reds. That's because adult coloring books demand the use of those colors in greater amounts than any company that makes pens, produces them. THIS set comes with actually brown shades, and greens that are different than any others. I've bought two sets now because the colors fit in with what I actually need to color! I wish more companies would do this. More brown, green, and reds. More neutrals (that actually show up). Thank you for these pens! Colors you actually need!"
2632102,B00CRQL8OW,5,my daughter loves these pens Five Stars
2632106,B00CRQL8OW,5,Work great for various arts n crafts. Awesome color selections and most of the colors are very bold!  The glitter pens are awesome and work great! So much glitter! Work great for various arts n crafts

2632110,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I loved these so much. All the colors were beautiful, but there was two or three repeats but that did bother me much given the price. I am a little disappointed about the amount of ink, there were some gel pens that were out of ink in one month! I still think these would be a perfect gift. I loved these so much"
2632111,B00CRQL8OW,5,They are very good quality. I have been using it for my studies. They help my notes to be dynamic and enjoyable. They are in a very good price. They are very good quality. I have been using it for my ...

2632116,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Very disappointed. These pens are so streaky, they make whatever you color look dull and ""lined"" they do not color smoothly. I am not going to play with them any longer. I don't color for anything other than my pleasure, I don't frame them or show others and it's a good thing after the two pages I finished with these. Streaky, not smooth"
2632117,B00CRQL8OW,4,Never used gel pens before. Takes a minute for the ink to dry - I suppose most people already know that.  The colors are true. Never used gel pens before. Takes a minute for ...

2632126,B00CRQL8OW,2,The ink bleeds thru.....? Two Stars
2632127,B00CRQL8OW,5,These pens are great for coloring.  I use them for coloring my handmade notecards and greeting cards in addition to my adult coloring books.  There are some with sparkles and some with a metallic finish that really look sharp! Happy!

2632129,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These gel pens are great! The only ones I don't really care for are the color changing ones, they seem to skip too much for coloring. Use for adult coloring book"
2632130,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Lots of vibrant colors, ink that flows smoothly, reasonable price, what's not to like?

One happy side effect of having these around the house.... when I present them to my kids along with a card for them to sign (birthday, Thanksgiving, thank you, etc), instead of just writing a quick sentence and signing their name, they are more inclined to write a paragraph and draw pictures to go along with it. Smooth writing.... happy side effect of owning"
2632131,B00CRQL8OW,1,Barely any ink in the pens and half of them don't work. Don't waste your $$$$

2632133,B00CRQL8OW,5,Good pens Five Stars
2632134,B00CRQL8OW,2,"The pens don't track that well. I'd probably say 3/5 write in passable sense. There appears to be some doubles in there too, where they ""aren't the same"" but they totally are. Good for kids/casual use. Not for serious work or for perfectionists. meh"
2632135,B00CRQL8OW,4,"They're okay. Some of the pens are very hard to get ink out of and others flow very well. For the price, I think you get a good product. I think you get a good product."

2632147,B00CRQL8OW,1,"I retracted my original review of 4 stars. After using these pens for a few weeks
I have reached the conclusion that I rate them 1 star. The pens flow rate is very slow necessitating having to shake the ink down to the point, or removing the cartridge and forcefully blowing air into the pen point. The pens are worth no more than 1 star. I should have contacted Amazon sooner. Poor Pens"
2632149,B00CRQL8OW,1,The ink was low in most of these pens.  Rip-off!!! One Star
2632150,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Honestly when I first bought this I was quite skeptical. But I must say Im very pleased with this product. They write very clean, don't skip on ink in between coloring, or writing. I will probably purchase another for my friend for Christmas. Over all great product highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. Highly recommend"

2632231,B00CRQL8OW,5,"This product is a fantastic purchase for the price. Gel pens are often quite expensive so it get a set of 48 for a very good price, I was pleased. There are many colors to choose from and none of the pens have ran out of ink yet. I have nothing but positive things to say about these colors. I also like that you can add a color onto a color. For example, if you color something with one pen and then put dots on top with another color of pen, it shows up fantastic. The only downfall I see is that they smear easily so you need to make sure it is dry and that your hand does not brush the ink when it is wet. This is usually typical for most gel pens, however. Great purchase and great price."
2632232,B00CRQL8OW,4,Item was exactly the way it appears online. Good quality!  I would make the purchase again Thumbs up!
2632233,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great fun pens that flow so smoothly and awesome colors.  I've been doing the adult coloring for stress and was using pencil colors, someone told me to get jel pens and so I got these.

These pens are FANTASTIC!  VERY pigmented, bright colors and very smooth.  They're a joy to write and color with.  They do not bleed through to the back page on the books I've tried them in so far.  The glitter colors are especially fun and look gorgeous.  I'll try to post pictures later of the finished pictures.  Such a great buy that I am going to order more for gifts and as an extra backup set! Great color, very pigmented and smooth!"

2632249,B00CRQL8OW,4,These were bought for my Octogenarian mother who loves the adult coloring books. She likes these because she doesn't have to press as hard as she does with pencils. The only complaint is they seem to run out fairly quickly. She uses greens more than other colors and I can't find a way to just replace that color.

The 48 piece set is split into four trays: one of metallic gel pens, one of glitter gel pens, one of regular gel pens, and one tray that's split between neon gel pens and multi-toned gel pens (the ones that start out one color and end up writing several different colors). I bought these on a whim and now they're my favorite pens for coloring. The pens themselves glide smoothly over the page and are perfect for brightening up a page without bleeding through. Great Variety Pack of Magical Gel Pens!"

2632270,B00CRQL8OW,4,I have really gotten into the adult coloring books and use pencils and the gel pens.  They are great for adding another dimension to the designs.  The only problem I found was the glitter lends tend to clog up.  Other wise the flow is soft and easy.  I would like them to be a little bit bigger around. Spark up that design!

2632341,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love gel pens and these are the best. The gel doesn't seem to get stuck, as some of the others I've used have. They work great all the time and are perfect for drawing and coloring. I bought these to use for an adult coloring book and I couldn't ask for any better. Love them!"
2632342,B00CRQL8OW,1,You get a lot of pens in pretty colors. Each pen is good for maybe three times of writing a little. The ink is used up very fast. I've never seen the ink in a pen be gone so fast. Not worth buying. Ink is gone too fast - worthless
2632343,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Very cool pen set, my 4yr old daughter likes therm a lot. My only two grips is the ink seems to run out pretty quickly and you need to hold them straight up and down more than the pens I'm used to, if you come at an angle the ball quits rolling. Very cool pen set"
2632344,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Multiple colors were the same in the package, so you're not really getting 48 unique colors. I use them for my adult coloring book and they glide and fill in really well. The ink does get depleted pretty quickly though. The ink does get depleted pretty quickly though"
2632345,B00CRQL8OW,4,This item came super fast and was exactly what I was hoping for. Pens write very well and the colors are true to picture and write boldly. Great pen
2632346,B00CRQL8OW,5,My 7-year-old loves these pens.  We've had them for a few months and she's used them quite a bit. Great pen set
2632347,B00CRQL8OW,2,"I read the reviews of everyone, so I thought I was getting some good gel pens. These pens are a joke, most of them don't work.  I am at the point of throwing them all away. It was a waste of my money. Warning to anyone who is thinking about buying them save your money . Bad prns"

2632361,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I love these pens for the variety of color they offer.  Some of them flow beautifully and some not as well, almost as though there is a bubble in the ink.  Even with this, I would purchase them again. Love the colors"

2632376,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These caught my eye when I was looking though the Amazon Daily Deals section. I had no need for gel pens whatsoever, but being a stationery junkie meant that I had to purchase them. So far I can say that I am completely satisfied with my purchase. The pens are very useful, for writing, coloring, pretty much anything you can imagine. They come in a variety of colors and styles (sparkly, neon, etc.) and are plentiful (48 is a lot). I would recommend these 100% percent. The pens are also high in quality and don't seem to bleed through paper or run out quick. They're so gorgeous I don't even want to use them!

In plastic trays. I also bought the pencils and like them also. Great gel pens......"
2632393,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These pens work so well. I looked at a bunch before finally deciding on these, I was worried because the price was on the lower side so I thought they might skip or not work as they should but I was happy to be wrong. I use them to write in my planner as well as do coloring pages. The different color selection is wonderful to have and you definitely can't beat the price. These pens exceeded my expectations!

2632411,B00CRQL8OW,1,"Do not buy these. Look for better quality than quantity. I bought the 2 pack, meaning 48 pens x 2boxes. It's very rough to use and ink runs very fast. Just waiting to finish the pack and never again will I buy this brand. Buy a better brand."

2632423,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I wanted something brighter and flashier than color pencils. They come with different types, including glitters and metallics. The case it comes in is kind of flimsy so I found something around the house to put them in. Great for using on Adult coloring books, either with colored pencils or other media.

2632447,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Some of the best pens I've ever use in adult coloring books. Vibrant colors, glitter and pastels included. My only suggestion would be to include more natural colors like browns, blues, and other earth tones. Some of the best pens I've ever use in adult coloring books"
2632448,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Some pens seem scratchy when you write with them. Other than that, the colors are nice and the price was very reasonable for what you get. Some are scratchy but still worth the purchase."
2632449,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Pens are very smooth.  Skip initially to get the ink flowing but once the pen is started, I have no complaints.  I utilize these with my Adult coloring pages and they provide a very vibrant color.  I purchased TWO sets for just under $12.00 total and it was an excellent value. Great Value !"
2632450,B00CRQL8OW,5,Nice colors Nice
2632451,B00CRQL8OW,1,I wish I could get my money back on this item. Not a good gel pen.  Out of the 48 maybe 30  will work.  They are scratchy.  Disappointed! SAD Artist!

2632460,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Lovely set of pens , my daughter is happy , so I'm happy great colors"
2632461,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Art is one of my hobbies and some of my projects are ""cards"". I make them and send to others for special occasions like birthdays and holidays.  Until purchasing these Gel pens, I used colored pencils, also made by LolliZ and they worked well.  It was cheap enough to try these pens so I did.

I wouldn't say that these pens totally replace colored pencils, they just give you a different way of coloring and a different effect.  Maybe this is not the correct way of describing the difference, but I think they deliver colors that are ""more intense"" than colored pencils.  Whether or not you want this, is, well, ""art"".

Since the packaging did not say that the gels were ""permanent"", I was concerned about this at first.  But, I did a test, wetting a dry sample.  I would say that they are substantially permanent.  Maybe there was a little smear in one place that I significantly wetted.  So, I'm not worried.

Another factor, maybe not a huge one, is that, unlike pencils, these pens don't have to be sharpened.  So, for the price of a set, I don't know how one could go wrong. Excellent Complement to Colored Pencils"
2632462,B00CRQL8OW,5,Very nice quality Gel Pen Set.  I expected cheap pens but these are put together very well. It is nice to have pens that don't bleed over into the next area. These are better quality than we are used to. The combination of standard and neon blends very well. The glitter and metallic seam to accent each other. Then the pastel and swirl are great to. My compliments to the manufactures. Very nice quality Gel Pen Set

2632469,B00CRQL8OW,5,Keeps the kids occupied for hours. They are a fantastic set. Awesome product at a super price
2632470,B00CRQL8OW,5,"For years I have been drawing with permanent markers and going into them with watercolor. I sat down with this set of pens, a pad of multimedia paper and a few conch shells to work from, and wow- these pens lay down smoothly, blend together, and are water soluble. I was able to use a brush and water to manipulate the ink in my drawing, creating subtle washes and color mixing. I cannot express how thrilled I am with these pens- the range of tan to brown pens are just what I needed for the seashell still life pieces I am currently working on. Superior Artist's Medium"
2632471,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I LOVE these pens! I bought them for me to use in my ""adult"" coloring books, but my daughter loved them too so I had to get another set for me after she took the first set over!

2632475,B00CRQL8OW,4,"This is my first set. Gel dries fast and doesn't smear.  Good Ink flow (slow start in a couple of pens). Same pastel pink, orange, yellow, green, blue, magenta are repeated, esp. in swirl, where 1 or 2 pens would do instead of 6. Would like an opaque white. Glitter & metallic have broadest color range.  Overall good. Good Ink flow (slow start in a couple of pens)"

2632489,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I have a few sets of gel pens as I'm really into adult coloring books right now. The biggest pro about this set is that it has brown! No other set that I have contains brown so I was having to supplement with markers and color pencils. With this set, I was able to do the bark of this tree!

The cons are that they skip slightly more than other sets and I really don't need any of the rainbow pens.

Overall, this is a good set and I'm very happy with my purchase. Great range of colors!"
2632490,B00CRQL8OW,5,Excellent for adult coloring books. The colors are fantastic and add a great touch when used with other coloring pencils and markers. Love it! Great for Adult Coloring Books

2632492,B00CRQL8OW,5,Oh my this was such a treat for me. Bought an adult coloring book and sat at Starbucks with a friend and colored. Such a break and the pretty colors really lifted my spirits.  Great points to help get in the tiny areas.  Seems like I tried most of them and did quite a bit of coloring when you add in the coloring the I sometimes do in the evening.  Looks like they will last a while.  Lots of colors. Great Price. So much fun playing with colors. Luv EM!
2632493,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love and have used! Adds great color to my pictures. Added to my craft collection. These work great
2632494,B00CRQL8OW,5,Awesome!!!!!!!!! Five Stars
2632495,B00CRQL8OW,5,Good price and all the pens work. A few coots were hard to tell apart but it doesn't bother me. I plan on using it for cards I make. Decent set of pens
2632496,B00CRQL8OW,5,Nice Pens
2632497,B00CRQL8OW,5,thanks! Five Stars
2632498,B00CRQL8OW,5,So far I have been very satisfied with these gel pens. Others I have purchased tend to skip or all together not work. So far I have been very satisfied with these gel pens
2632499,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I bought these to add to my coloring pans for my coloring books. I have been very pleased. I got them on sale for $11.99 so for 48 gels pens I feel that you cannot beat that price. There is a range of types of pens; neon, metallic, swirl, glitter, milky and standard. I have one pen that has blobbed out and I felt I was more pushing ink into the places than coloring. That took a few minutes to dry and then I have had a couple that have skipped or the flow has reduced. That has been more on the glitter and metallic pens. Overall I love these pens and the selection of colors that have been offered. They come in a hard plastic box with dividers if you want to keep using if for storage it is a good option. I have enjoyed adding the finishes to my coloring. Personally I would not use them to color large areas but they are  great for details. I would look to purchase again. Nice selection of pens"
2632500,B00CRQL8OW,5,The granddaughters will love these for Christmas stocking stuffers. Five Stars
2632501,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great value. Five Stars
2632502,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Got these pens for my coloring books.  Wanted something different to use when coloring instead of the pencils.  Really do like these pens, love the colors, glad I purchased them. Great purchase !"
2632503,B00CRQL8OW,5,"There are a good variety of colors and only a couple of repeat colors that may be just a tad shade different. Most every pen goes on smooth with a few exceptions that seemed to stop working intermittent. These go on pretty wet and will smudge if you do not allow them to dry before touching. On the plus side, I could dab the color off some of the black lines before it dried on. If you get out of the lines, some of the colors will go on pretty thick to cover the mistake. Good value for the amount of pens you get. I have only found one pen or two pens that wrote a little rough but after scribbling on something they worked ok. There are a good variety of colors and only a couple of repeat ..."
2632504,B00CRQL8OW,5,I buy these gel pens for my 88 year old mom. She loves them for coloring in her adult coloring books. I have bought three sets of these pens in the last 6 months for her. Great gel pens

2632506,B00CRQL8OW,1,30/70 pens have started to leak. The ends have been leaking no matter what position I keep them in. Would recommend another brand. They leak!

2632508,B00CRQL8OW,4,"The ink flows really freely, and I'm super happy with the quality.  The only downside is that the set is a bit heavy on the pastels.  The swirl colors are the exact same colors as the pastel pens, and there are 2 each pink and orange pastel pens in the set.  Still, for the money it was a good buy. and I'm super happy with the quality"

2632520,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These are great pens...don't glob and are always ""ready"" to flow. Nice colors from which to choose, loving the variety between glitter, flat, and neon. Colors are vibrant and the ink doesn't seem to penetrate through the paper. These are great pens."

2632527,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great Price for these pens.  Got them as a little addon gift for my wife's bday and she loves them.  Gel pens in general don't have the longest life but with so many pens to choose from you can go nuts! Great Pens!
2632528,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Lots of colors, some use up more quickly than others. Value for the money nice set of gel pens"
2632529,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love the array of vibrant colors, and know the girls will love the sparkle colors.  I tried one out, a sparkle magenta.  After the usual brief scribble to start a new pen, it wrote smoothly with no skipping.  The sparkles are more apparent when coloring in a small area than when you're just making lines.  Plastic case is thin but adequate for storage, although it won't last as long as a crayon box or one of those vinyl-like pouches that crayola markers come in.  Mine came packaged additionally in a thin white cardboard box, which will make it easier and nicer to wrap as a gift. Nice to give -- or get!"
2632530,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Due to the price and variety of this set ($12) vs. other sets (upwards of $25+), I really didn't have high expectations for these, but I gotta tell you, they completely surpassed my expectations! They're great pens and a great value as well! I thoroughly recommend them. Obviously some of them write smoother than others, for example, the pastel colors don't write as well as the glitter and metallic ones, but that's to be expected. And overall, they're good quality, so I give them 5 stars. Don't waste your money but in other sets for $25 or more for less pens. These work wonderful and are half of the cost! Great buy! Great value and product"

2632537,B00CRQL8OW,5,I bought these for my friend who wanted to try gel pens for her adult coloring.  She was delighted with them. She said that the pens glide easily over the paper and that there is a very good choice of colors. She was delighted with them

2632545,B00CRQL8OW,5,"As a former art teacher, I can tell you that these pens are excellent. They are wonderful for the new adult coloring books now so very popular. The only caution that you have to watch out for is that, because they are gel pens, they will smear if you accidentally rub the paper as you use them without letting them ""dry"" first. The other great additional feature is that some of the gel inks contain ""iridescent sparkle"" inks which will add to your finished work. This former art teacher recommends these pens!"

2632601,B00CRQL8OW,1,I purchased these about a month ago.  When I pulled them out to use them I discovered that there were several pens that were not working.  No color would come out of the pens.  Not worth the cost of the pens. Not worth the cost

2632640,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I bought these as a gift for my best friend who has recently taken up adult coloring books. The great thing about Amazon is you can pay but ship somewhere else. Once she received them, she hasn't been able to stop using them! She absolutely LOVES them! Those are her words and all caps. She hasn't had any problems with any of the pens. Once you get them started the ink flows smoothly and the colors are gorgeous. No bleed through and no smears. She is very happy with them! Best For Adult Coloring!"
2632641,B00CRQL8OW,2,"***updated after a couple months of use**** I am very disappointed to report that I have used probably a dozen of these pens so far, they work great until about half of its use and then the ink skips. It has happened with every single pen. It's really frustrating!!! Ink skips after half of the use of ink"
2632642,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These are great pens.  My daughter loves them.  My daughter uses them for her coloring books and it helps to stay in the lines.  They are not too great when it comes to coloring a big area because they have such a fine point.  They also run out somewhat fast.  Overall, I am pleased though.  I plan on looking for some more maybe with a wider point. These are great pens. My daughter loves them"
2632643,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I really like the price of these pens!  The colors are bright and vibrant!  I tested out all 48 pens and they all write beautifully.  There are 6 standard, 6 neon, 6 swirl, 12 glitter, 10 metallic, 8 milky.  They are acid free.  The tip is 0.8 - 1.0 mm.  There is even an apple green and a lime green among the group of 48.  I am very happy with my purchase. Great colors"
2632644,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Wow, what can I say about these. Nice color pay off, neons are extra neon, pastels really pastels and the glitter ones are really pretty. I got these as a gift for my wife and we tested them when they arrived. They are really good quality and they are a bargain comparing this kind of set to other ones that have even less colors. Really happy with the purchase nice pay off"
2632646,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love using gel pens for journaling and coloring in adult coloring books. These pens all worked, wrote smoothly and haven't run out of ink super quickly like some gel pens tend to do. You do have to take care to avoid smearing and smudging, but I think these dry and set more quickly than some other pens I've tried, so I haven't really had any issues with a lot of smearing.

The pens can bleed through a bit if the paper is thin, especially if you're coloring heavily in one of the darker colors, but I don't have any issues with bleeding in most of my adult coloring books and my journal, which have thicker, heavier paper.

The pens are sturdy and the caps snap on tightly on each and every pen I received. This was a great price for 48 pens, and I feel like I got every color I could want. I particularly enjoy the glitter and metallic inks, but they are all pretty.

The only thing I could possibly list as a con to this set is that the plastic case they come in is made of that thin packaging plastic that bends easily and can have sharp edges. I didn't mind because I took all of the pens out and put them in a large zippered pouch I have, but if you're planning on using the little case they come in to store them, you'll need to be gentle and careful when taking them out and putting them back in or it will break down quickly.

Bottom line: They write smoothly, lots of color and ""texture"" options, minimal smudging and bleeding. I would definitely recommend these pens to anyone who is looking for an inexpensive set with a lot of colors that will still perform well. Great inexpensive set - smooth, minimal smudging and bleeding"

I took a chance on these after reading other reviews, and I'm so glad I did.  This are incredible for the price!  They write smoothly, do not clump, do not bleed, do not skip or have missing spots where ink did not flow.  I HIGHLY recommend these. Get these, you won't be sorry."

For the price, they make great birthday gifts.  My only gripe is the packaging. The plastic box is cumbersome for a child and a bit flimsy. We've relocated the pens into several cups for her desk and threw out the box. they make great birthday gifts"
2632704,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Wow! I have been doing some coloring lately in the adult coloring books some friends bought for me, and have quite a few markers, but I had no idea what a difference these gel pens would make. I really like them a lot. I used a few of my other markers other than these in the picture (the black and the border mostly), but the rest was from this brand of gel pens. HIGHLY recommend. I'm bedridden, for the most part, so I have to find things to keep me busy. The colors really pop and make me want to play with them even more. GET THESE! Had no idea about gel pens..."

2632714,B00CRQL8OW,5,"You haven't lived until you've used gel pens for coloring in those intricate designs in your favorite adult coloring books.  SMOOTH and NON-CLOGGING - These pens are a dream come true for the adult coloring book fan!  I especially love the variety you get, and for the quality, this price can't be beat.  This 48 pen set comes with metallic, swirl, glitter, neon and a matte (they refer to as milky).  Most sets this large have duplicates pens - not this set - they are all different.  Although the pens come in their very neat and tidy case which can be reused, I am not so tidy and usually end up with my pens all around me in various piles.  The point is if you are a neat freak, you can keep them in the tidy case.  Another plus is that the pen caps do attach and stay on the pen ends...believe it or not lots of pen sets out there have caps that do not fit so tightly which will contribute to premature drying of your 'new best friends.'  While I use these primarily for coloring, I've also used these to keep my paper calendar and make grocery lists.  Life is just more fun in color! ADULT COLORING BOOK FANS!!"
2632715,B00CRQL8OW,5,Gel pens were what I expected pleased
2632716,B00CRQL8OW,5,Excellent product... Five Stars
2632717,B00CRQL8OW,5,I am a teacher and I purchased these for prizes/give-aways for my students. Kids absolutely LOVE gel pens and these are no exception. The ink flows very well and the color assortment is fantastic. I can't believe the quality and amount I got for the price! None of the 48 were dried up and everything was in perfect condition. These exceeded my expectations!~ Awesome assortment & great ink flow!!
2632718,B00CRQL8OW,4,"This is a nice, big assortment of gel pens. The metallic and glitter are my favorite ones.  There are a few duplicate colors in there, but they're the colors I'm likely to use up quickly, so I don't mind.  Most of the pens write very smoothly with very little skipping.  The only exception I've found to that are the swirly ones.  For some reason those ones tend to skip quite a bit. This is a nice, big assortment of gel pens"
2632719,B00CRQL8OW,1,"Not impressed basically a colored BIC pen, no fine point, colors bleed, a few of the pens were dry. I am getting serious about my adult coloring book and cheap gel colors are not acceptable for me. Get what you pay for! Not worth the money to purchase. This pen is more for writing than coloring.

2632723,B00CRQL8OW,2,"I am not impressed with these gel pens, the color choices are poor, they produce very thin line, and even the set is large--I could only use a few of them, they are only for the drawing on regular paper of 50 lb or less, not for the fine arts I wanted to use them for-- in mixed media. I would not give them to a small child, because they take everything to mouth. not so good"
2632724,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Kids have been using these for a week now and this is the first set of gel pens we've ever owned that have actually worked without frustration. If that changes I'll come back and update, but LOVING these! They Work!"

Glitter
Metallic
Milky
Neon
Mixed colors! The mixed ones are really cool. One pen writes in multiple colors.

There are four trays enclosed, each with 12 pens. The pens go back in their trays really nicely and kind of lock into place by the pen cap, so it's easy to slide the trays right back into the case.

Great for adult or detail coloring books, scrapbooking, card making, Illustrated Faith Bible journaling, day planners, or just to have a fun set of colorful pens to write with.

Excellent gift, and perfect for the pen-lover in your life :). Plus, for this price, you seriously can't beat it. I highly recommend this set. Quality Gel Pens"

2632748,B00CRQL8OW,4,"At first I really loved these pens.  The colors are vibrant and work great on my adult coloring books.  However, they do run out pretty quickly.  I plan to purchase anther set because I was in the middle of a larger color when my pen stopped working.  I even like the swirl colors even though initially I thought I would not.  Over all, great product for the price.  They just run out quick. Vibrant colors.  Perfect for adult coloring books."
2632749,B00CRQL8OW,4,All of the colors worked and most went on the paper very smoothly.  The glitter ones get clogged a bit more easily but overall they are a good set. Good
2632750,B00CRQL8OW,5,I JUST HAD TO ORDER THESE GEL PENS AFTER I PURCHASED THE GLOW IN THE DARK COLORING BOOK AND THEY WORK SO GOOD AND THE COLORS ARE SO VIBRANT  I RECIEVED THIS ITEM AT A DISCOUNTED OR REDUCED CHARGE FOR MY HONEST OPINION AND REVIEW GREAT BUY
2632751,B00CRQL8OW,5,working great when coloring Five Stars
2632752,B00CRQL8OW,4,Nice set of gel pens.  I got a great deal on these. Nice pens
2632753,B00CRQL8OW,4,"While the colors are great, some of the pens write better than others in terms of the flow of ink. What I don't like is that I have several duplicates. I have two exact: Black, Pink and Orange. I'm not talking about glitter and non, I mean EXACTLY the same. I'm not too happy. Just beware and go through all of the pens as I have. See photos below. The black has 3, 2 standard and one glitter. Don't get me wrong, these are so beautiful, they really are! But, when I ordered the Sakura I never had an issue, they have a limited color palette, I needed a wider range. I would have ordered more and I'm glad I didn't order a larger set. I'm really scared to order from them again. I wonder what are the colors I'm missing. Just beware. The Colors are Great"
2632756,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Left handed people might not have such glowing things to say about these pens.  The ink is slow to dry, so it is very easy to smudge it across the page and onto the side of the hand.  This isn't an uncommon issue for lefties - but usually gel pens are very fast to dry on the page.  In my tests, a sample still smudges 5-6 seconds after being written, which is probably mostly a problem for us Southpaws.

There's a real sense of drag using a few colors of these pens, which I tend to associate more with lower-end  Bics rather than gel pens like Pilot.  The colors I've tried tend to scratch across the page, and the ink application is sometimes a little on the blobby side, or missing in the middle of the pen stroke.  As a multicolored writing instrument, I'm not thrilled by these.  But, for adding a tiny bit of color and interest to a page, they'll certainly do the job at this price point.  They may even be good for lefties who enjoy coloring, since you may not move in a strictly left-to-right fashion. Wondering if I got the same pens as everyone else."
2632757,B00CRQL8OW,5,Fun! I just started coloring again at 57 and I love it but I wanted more then my colored pencils. The textures and added colors of these pens are the perfect addition to my coloring pages. These made a great add-on to my cards and letters too. Perfect for the fun of coloring or scrapbooking.
2632758,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love these gel pens!! I used them for my adult coloring book and the colors were beautiful. Gel came out quickly and smooth upon first use. The colors are vibrant. They didn't bleed heavily through the back of my paper.  I also like that inside the box there are 4 separate boxed trays to help keep the pens neat and organized by type of gel pen. I feel like I got such an awesome deal for the price. In the store you wouldn't get nearly as many pens for 10 bucks. Highly recommend. Awesome gel pens, amazing price!"

Metallic colors are my favorite. They sparkle nicely

2632772,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Excellent set of pens for myself and my 9 year old daughter.  The closest we could come to a complaint is that just like other pen sets we've tried, the orange glitter pen runs out way too soon, but that traces to it being a favorite color.  After our first pack to experiment with, I bought two more to send with my daughter to her grandmother's house for visits there, and her Nana loves them too.  All the pens worked just fine.  The pastel colors are a bit chalky and don't flow as well as the others, but that's to be expected. Nice set of pens for the price"

There is enough glitter which  isn't always the case with gel pens. I'm going to order the two pack next time as I fear I am using the ink very quickly! They are that good. The pens are also acid free so they are perfect for scrapbooking. Perfect for coloring and scrapbooking too!"

2632791,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I've just started using adult coloring books & wanted a set of gel pens to use. These are awesome pens. It takes a little bit to start the ink flowing, but when it does, it goes on smoothly and glides over the paper. Colors are vibrant. Just find that the metallic ones feel a little bit scratchy when just starting to be used. Totally enjoying them! Awesome pens!"

2632799,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I received these pens today and am surprised with the variety of colors it comes with!
There are sets of metallic pens, ""milky"" pens, neon pens, glitter pens, and standard pens. It ranges from darker colors to very bright colors. The gel does not smear and glides onto the page smoothly. I can't wait to make beautiful drawings with a variety of colors.
The glitter color is also not tacky glitter but very sparkly and pretty!:) I am very happy with these and am surprised that I got them for such a cheap price.
The packaging it comes it also makes them simple to store! I would definitely recommend this product for anyone looking for a variety of colors at an affordable price.

As you can see in the picture, the colors are as shown and come in a nice variety. The neons are very vibrant, and the sparkle color is very glitter like. Huge variety of colors!"
2632800,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great pens for the price!  I ordered these for my daughter for a Christmas gift along with an adult coloring book. They have been so popular I've ordered several more sets for other family members and friends (at their request)! Great pens for the price!

2632829,B00CRQL8OW,5,Uses for my adult coloring book.. Colors are great! Colors are great!
2632830,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These are quality pens, and I LOVE the glitter and metallic ones, but fully six of them are a complete waste. Who wants to color with a pen that will change colors on you in the middle of your work? I also ended up with two colors that had duplicates in the package, which I was not expecting and was a bit disappointed by. Great glitter and metallics, but also useless ""swirl"" pens and some dupes"

2632834,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Very good gel pens. I was wary because of the negative reviews, but I was pleasantly surprised. I tested all of them and none of the pens skipped, and there was a great variety of colors. Some of them are nearly identical (and possibly exact duplicates), but only a few so I don't mind. This set is a great deal for the price, and I love them! Very good gel pens"
2632835,B00CRQL8OW,5,First I have bought.  They are great.  Work smoothly. Will definitely buy this brand again. Great value
2632836,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great product! I love the variety and the gel pens are super smooth. Perfect for coloring books! Love the variety!

2632839,B00CRQL8OW,5,Many varieties of gel pens Gel Pens
2632840,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I like these pens, especially the glitter pens. I use these in a lot of my intricate adult coloring books because the ink will not bleed through the page and ruin the design on the back of what I am coloring.

I do find that getting them started and/or keeping the ink flowing is challenging for me. I am left handed, so I don't know if it's the angle that I hold the pen that reduces or stops the flow of ink or something else.

Lefty tip: Make this the last thing that you add to your drawings or you'll end up with ink all over your hand. If I add glitter or metallic to a coloring page when I am first starting the coloring process, I find that it ends up all over me because I am continually dragging my hand through the ink. This is true even days after applying it to the page. Pretty Glitter and Metallics - Warning for Lefties"
2632841,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Pens are nice, but put out too much ink and run out quickly. Four Stars"
2632842,B00CRQL8OW,4,I love these pens for the price! I am into adult coloring books and they dry quickly and don't smear like others I have used. As with many (all?) gel pens If You color one area it can get a little streaky with certain colors but most of the colors work perfect.  Seems to last a decent amount of time. Good buy!
2632844,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Fantastic selection of a variety of colors and textures.  I purchased 4 trays, I love working with them that much. Fantastic selection of a variety of colors and textures"

But other than that, they're really great! A good variety for everyone. I've used swirly gel pens that work so well! Dilvery was fast, and none were broken! Really great, but...."

2632860,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these pens and this is the only company with a great price. I've bought several for friends and family too. Love these!

2632866,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love these pens.  Having children, I was re-introduced to coloring and have bought several of the Creative Haven coloring books (they are awesome) and these pens are perfect.  Very little, if any, bleeding through pages and they cover very well.  The milky ones do have a tendency to skip but overall very happy with these.  So happy that I bought another set as they get lots of use. I love these pens"
2632867,B00CRQL8OW,5,I bought these pens for my adult coloring books. They have been so fun to use. Lots of different colors and textures of pens. They definitely save your wrist when doing a lot of coloring in the books. I've noticed that colored pencils strain my wrist after a while. I would definitely buy more of these.  My kids are already begging for a set up their own. Great pen!
2632868,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Most of the pens did just fine. I love the metallic pens and the glitter pens. The dark green and dark blue pens were a little disappointing; they kept skipping and felt a little dry. I haven't worked with most of the pastel colors yet, so I can't really comment on them. All in all, though, I'm really enjoying these pens so far. Enjoyable so far"

2632875,B00CRQL8OW,5,My favorite pens for adult coloring books. Five Stars
2632876,B00CRQL8OW,5,I was skeptical of these because I've not had much luck with gel pens in the past (they never write well) but took a chance and am glad I did - these are amazing! They write so smoothly and are perfect for my adult coloring book. The colors are so vibrant as well. Very happy with these pens!! Fantastic gel pens!
2632879,B00CRQL8OW,5,Pleased with this product.  No bleeding through strong stock. Gel Pens
2632880,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great quality at a good price.  This is exactly what I was looking for. These are perfect
2632881,B00CRQL8OW,5,"The trays are annoying but that is my only complaint, great assortment and all have worked well. Five Stars"
2632882,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These pens have nice,bright colors, and flow smoothly onto the paper.  The variety of colors makes it fun, as there are ways to have shadows and highlights on the projects I create.  I would like to see different pen caps or some other way to better differentiate the different types of inks, however (glitter from the neon or regular, in other words), as just looking at the barrel can be a little deceiving, particularly in less-than-perfect lighting.  Sometimes I don't want a glitter finish on one of my papers, and inadvertently have picked a pen and have started  to see that ink before realizing it was not the type of ink I initially wanted.  Otherwise, these are a great product, especially for the price. Good color choices; Good value"

2632887,B00CRQL8OW,5,Everything I expected. Gel Pens
2632888,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These are really good gel pens to use in the shut coloring books. Most of the pens have ink that flows really nicely and smooth, but some are harder to get the ink out. So far none have bled through any of my pages. My only complaint is that the actual colors don't really vary alot. The color on the caps make you think they are different but once you start coloring then they are very very similar. For example the purples all seem to be dark purple, blues all seem dark, etc. Wish there were some lighter shades without them being neon. I would definitely buy again though, especially for this price. Great for the price!"
2632889,B00CRQL8OW,5,they all write smoothly and great for coloring no repeat colors Five Stars
2632890,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I bought the LolliZ Gel Pen Set as a Mother's Day gift for my Mom whom is 89 yrs. old and resides in a Senior Living Facility.  She loved them and the adult coloring book.  She used to oil paint, but due to the mess of the oils, brushes, and solvents...this has become more difficult.  My order arrived in a timely manner, and I know that this will not be my last order of gel pens! LolliZ Gel Pens 48 Gel Pen Tray Set"
2632891,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love it Amazing
2632892,B00CRQL8OW,5,"My wife likes to doodle - and she loves these brightly colored markers.  She sits around and draws funny faces on the photos in all the magazines we get.  The fact that she enjoys these markers keeps me from that frustrating task of trying and teach her Photoshop.  I tried to color the cats nose and eyebrows with them - but he wasn't having any part of that.  So no, not good for coloring the cat. Nice to doodle with."
2632893,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Got these as a mothers day gift and they are great! These are perfect for adult coloring books and the color comes out looking very good. I love these and want some more!

If my review was at all helpful to you please click the relevant button, thank you. Love Them"
2632894,B00CRQL8OW,5,was worried with the reviews on some new pens with little or less ink and was happily satisfied to see all pens full. My 12 yr. old got into coloring with them from school and now we have colorful artwork hanging all over our walls. Happy artist = Happy Mother!
2632895,B00CRQL8OW,2,"I can not figure out why everyone raves about these pens.  Compared to other gel pens on the market, I certainly would not buy these or recommend them.  I tried using them in adult coloring books.  I won't even try to complete a picture with them.  The ink does not go on smooth at all.  Sometimes it goes on scratchy and leaves lines, then other times, it pools like too much ink is coming out at once.  It takes a while to dry.  When it did, I tried using a blending pen to smooth out the colors, which worked a bit.  I certainly don't want to have to do this with entire coloring sheets. Not sure why everyone raves about these"
2632896,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Arrived quickly. All of the colors are very pretty. The twisted color pens are a little difficult, the color will randomly come out odd and a little too light so you have to go back over it but the color is changing so you might not get the same color. All the rest are great though. They come out smooth and vibrant. I will buy again when I'm out So much variety!"
2632897,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love them.  Wide array of colors (2 are duplicated).  I always store them in the container the opposite way they are pictured here so that the ink is being pulled down by gravity and I never have any issues with the ink not working.  When my pens run out, I will definitely purchase these again!  I use them for coloring books, and they do not bleed through the page.  Highly recommend! Highly recommend!"
2632898,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These are terrific, very reasonably priced, and a huge selection of colors. All of the colors flow great, all of the colors are different, seem to be very freshly made, I have not had one dud. The packaging is fabulous, you can take out a tray of 12 to work with, this makes it easy to do special effects. Six different kinds of inks, milky, glitter, swirl, etc. If you buy these you will be impressed! Great gel pens!"

2632910,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Third set I've purchased and definitely my favorite! If I could have given 4 1/2 stars that would be more appropriate because they are perfect except that I don't use or like the neons and there are a lot in this set. Also some duplicate colors. But otherwise they are full of ink, vibrant, and on the finer side for gel pens. Great assortment as well although I could do without the weird neon marbled colors since I only use these for adult coloring books. Great set and great quality"
2632911,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I have enjoyed using these pens.  I would like to be able to refill them, but the fun of using them far out weights the idea of having to recycle the used pens.  I will purchase them again.  Blessings to you I have enjoyed using these pens"
2632913,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Was disappointed by these. Came highly rated by a friend who also ""colors for stress relief "" and after only 2 6 inch by 6 inch coloring pages in a book, 4 of these pens were almost empty. The green, neon pink, brown and neon yellow were just about dry. Had been talked into trying these because of their brightness over pencils, but if they run out that quick, I will stick with colored pencils for cost effectiveness. Runs out way too quick"
2632914,B00CRQL8OW,2,First 2 times I bought these...it money well spent.this time I was disappointed. Its supposed to calm me ( coloring right? ) well I was super irritsted this time I was disappointed. Its supposed to calm me ( coloring right

2632940,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Hello,  My name is sherri and I am a gel pen addict.  Ever since I started adult coloring, I can't seem to stop ordering gel pens.  There is just something about them that calls to me.  All those bright colors,  with metallics and glitter.  (swoon)  I have or 6 sets now, including the expensive Techwriters and a small set of the gelly rolls.  They are bright with a great selection and not to wet. I find some gel pens are just to wet and tend to bleed over the lines or smudge  more easily.  There  is also a good selection of colors.

These pens are as nice as any others except maybe the gelly roll glitters.  The price makes them even nicer.  Amazon puts them on sale often so if you are going to buy them, wait for the sale.  I have seen the 96 pen set often for $15 and wish I would have known that before I ordered this 48 pen set for  $10.

When I first got them, I set myself to the project of doing a picture with every single color/pen.  You can judge the color selection and quality for yourself. Gel pens anonymous?"

2632942,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I only tested these and havrn't done any art with thdm yet but, they write very smooth the colors are vibrant.  I love thd single trays that slide out of the box for neat organization of the pens.  Ill recommend these LolliZ Gel Pens for any task.  Im glad I bought them and didn't confuse myself with thd huge variety of brands available.  I read reviews on these and thats what sold me.  The previous users/reviewers got it right so,  so did I..!!   I was using my new LolliZ gel pens tge other day and as I said, I'd come back to review how well they work.  The glitter pens are so nice!  I did a whole picture eith them!!! I couldn't put them down!!! Very very smooth, like a marker but better.  The glitter effect is tiny glittering.  Not huge bits of glitter.  Im super impressed with how smooth they color.  The 48 piece variety kept me interested in coloring longer than I normally do.  I'm gonna say again..... buy the LolliZ gel pens.  You won't be sorry.  I'll be buying another set of these when they run dry.  They would make a great gift also for a friend or family with like interests.. Best affordable brand and great quality...LolliZ Gel Pens"
2632943,B00CRQL8OW,4,"The pens work great! A note to the manufacturer though,  the pens could be stored easier with a flat piece of plastic that the clips slide over than the molded one they come with. It'd be better for the consumer and it'd cost like,  a penny less per unit. Just about perfect."
2632944,B00CRQL8OW,5,Nice pens. Great colors and good price Five Stars
2632946,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these gel pens!  They have brights and regular colors in the box and there is even a set of 12 glitter gel pens included!  Very happy with the product for the price and they arrived very quickly! Arrived fast and lots of variety

2632948,B00CRQL8OW,1,These gel pens are terrible. They bleed like crazy and become very messy. I do not recommend them at all. No good. Terrible!
2632949,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I love coloring with these gel pens, the coverage is so smooth. The color are bright and vibrant. This pack of gel pens is a great bargain, you get 48 beautiful colors.

You get 12 glitter, 6 neon, 6 swirl, 10 metallic, 8 milky, and 6 standard. These gel pens make your coloring pages come to life, and just jump off the page.

I liked them so much that I ordered two set of these 48 pens.

They can be used to color the whole page or just use to highlight a special area.

I recommend this product to anyone who loves to color the way that I do. I love coloring with gel pens."

2632975,B00CRQL8OW,5,Excellent set of Gel Pens at a very good price. All of them were working very well and were not dried up. Will order more when these lose their zest. As with most of my Amazon orders arrived right on time with Prime. HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE!
2632976,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love the variety of colors.  The down side is they run out quickly. Each pen is different. Some of them are the same color but different in that they are metallic, glitter or plain. The marble/swirl ones are pretty cool too. They do not always show marbling when used, but it does look pretty cool when they do.  Colors are vibrant, if you take your time you do not see a lot of streaking/pen marks in the colors which is a plus. For the price I will most likely order them again.

I included 2 pictures, the round one is done with the gel pens except the background blue which is done in colored pencil. The dragonfly is not completed, but I wanted to show the cool marbling effect. You can see some streaking in the purple glitter parts, but I believe if I go over it again it the streaks will go away.  The pictures are from the ""Enchanted Forest: An Inky Quest & Coloring book"" by Johanna Basford. Vibrant colors, fun to use."
2632977,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I think these pens are pretty decent for the price, but they do have their pitfalls.

I think that the color selection isn't very varied. I think they are fine for pattern coloring and coupled with colored pencils. I don't think they work very well for ""garden"" or regular coloring. Some of the colors are too psychedelic for me.
The pens seem not have a ton of ink. I have colored for a couple of weeks with this set, but I will probably have to buy another set in a month.

That being said; I like them because they are easier on my arthritic hands, they colors are vibrant, they haven't bled through any of the pages, and the metallic and glitter colors are fun to work with. A love hate relationship"
2632978,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These pens are awesome.  The ink flows smoothly and the colors are vibrant.  Some of the pens have very similar colors, just a shade lighter or darker.  I've only used them on adult coloring books, not normal paper, so not sure if they would bleed through.  Definitely worth buying. will buy again."
2632979,B00CRQL8OW,4,Vibrant colors Four Stars
2632981,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Most of the pens work just fine, some are a little dry. Pretty good pens"

2632984,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these they are a great value.  Will order them again. Nice color variety and metallic and glitters are great! Good set will . Order again!
2632985,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Pack has a large variety of color. The ink is smooth flowing and not draggy. Very good for adult coloring books which is what I purchased them for. Love them. Perfect pens, lots of vibrant color."
2632986,B00CRQL8OW,5,"If you love coloring, these are the pens for you! The ink comes out evenly and smoothly, even the ""glittery"" colors. I mostly used up one set already and I'm on my second set! I have no complaints, except a nicer packaging would be nice. You'll love these pens."
2632987,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great gel pens for all ages!  Good quality and great variety of colors! Great pen set for gel lovers

2632991,B00CRQL8OW,5,These pens are great Five Stars
2632992,B00CRQL8OW,4,"As a first time buyer of gel pens I wanted something cheap so that if I didn't like them I wouldn't have wasted a ton of money so I decided to get these. I use them for adult coloring in a variety of coloring books.
Pros:
cheap price
smooth writing
great variety of colors

Cons:
you have to scribble a bit to get some of the pens ink flowing smoothly
unmentioned duplicates(standard black, standard blue, neon orange, neon pink) Awesome pens!"
2632993,B00CRQL8OW,5,So many pretty colors and they write and color well. Only thing is when they dry the color is not as vibrant as the lid would indicate. But still perfect for my coloring book. Wonderufl colors
2632994,B00CRQL8OW,5,love for the price paid.. will buy more if on sale..good for gifting
2632995,B00CRQL8OW,2,The pens don't roll like gel pens are saposta to and they leave lines throughout the pictures because the ink has to set I guess. Not only that but the ink runs right out of the pen whet her it's upside down right side up or flat. Don't waste your money like me!! The pens don't roll like gel pens are saposta to and they leave lines ...

The wide array of colors, as well as choice of standard, glitter or metallic finishes, to name a few- will make every skill level of artist feel like a PRO.
 If you go to your local ""Dollar"" store, various brands of gel pens start at $1 and maybe go up to $1.50.

2633004,B00CRQL8OW,5,If you are into adult coloring these are awesome!!!  I love love love these gel pens. I just recently got another set and got one for my friend. There is nothing bad about them. Buy them and see for yourself. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE
2633005,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I originally bought two packs of these. One for myself and one for my daughter. We love to color the adult coloring books but the colored pencils do not give then the pizazz they deserve so I thought these would be awesome, and they did not disappoint!!! They are sooooooooo smooth and disperse the perfect amount of gel!! I wasn't a huge fan of the rainbow ones but loved the  sparkles!!! But the very best part about these is that my grandmother has found a love and a calm in coloring now too but she had to stop due to her carpal tunnel :( when we took the gel pens over to color at her house, she picked up the gel pens to color and they didn't bother her at all, do we ordered more!!!! I will probably end up buying a case of these!!! Thanks for having such a great product! Hard to find online these days :) :) LOVE THESE!!! (BOUGHT 4 PACKS)"

2633011,B00CRQL8OW,2,I have ordered these numerous times and I keep ordering them because they are the best ones I can find. This last two orders have been bad though . They don't flow smoothly or they don't work at all. I hope when I order them again they work like they used too if I order them again . I counted them. I have ordered these ten times in the last six month. Y oh could replace the bad ones for me. ... and I keep ordering them because they are the best ones I can find

2633019,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Nice pens, love the glitters and metallics. Sadly while you do get 48 pens, you don't actually get 48 colors, the pack I received had several sets of doubles. Nice pens, love the glitters and metallics"
2633020,B00CRQL8OW,5,My daughter and friends love these pens! Great value - I will definitely purchase more. Five Stars
2633021,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I bought this set to do adult coloring. The package is very sturdy,  Each set of 12 is in its own tray. The metallic colors have a sheen to them that really pops on paper. The pastels are light but bright. The glitter pens have just the right amount of sparkle to not be overwhelming. I don't particularly care for the neon pens. Some of the lighter neon mixed colors do not match what the cap says the color is suppose to be. These pens produce a line from thin to thick. The ink flows very easily, without having to push hard. As a plus, they even keep writing when the pen is held when I color with the paper against the wall. I've used these to color several pictures, and the ink is still full, so expect them to last awhile. All in all, an excellent set that I will buy again. Excellent set"
2633022,B00CRQL8OW,4,Not all the pens work Four Stars
2633023,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These were surprisingly AMAZING! The come in a box with 4 rows of pens. One row (has neon colored and color changing pens) weren't my favorite. They definitely didn't write as smoothe. They were just fine, but I wanted to throw them out after trying the rest! These pens are so smooth and write so well you'd have to try one to understand. Highly recommend! Fantastic"
2633024,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Not too long ago I ordered a set of gel pens and surprise, my kids stole them. I went back online to order another set and found these. I originally purchased them because they came with several more colors and when they arrived I was blown away. The colors are amazing. These are for sure the absolute best gel pens I've ever used. I wish I had gone ahead and ordered the double pack. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a good gel pen. They're great for my adult coloring books and I love, love, love them. Amazing color."
2633025,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Not super happy with these. Many of them only lasted 20 times using the pen. They are not completely filled with ink and thus the short time span.
The pens that are 'mixed' and have 3 different colors in them, start to blend together after using only 3 times! Very disappointing. Not worth the money"
2633026,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Very nice pens, they write smooth and look great. I like the variety of glitter, metallic, neon, and swirly. There are 12 pens per plastic flat in the container but they aren't easy to use to take out a pen and then replace it back in the flat. So I just have them all loose in the plastic box. I would have liked a better way to store them. Very nice pens, they write smooth and look great"
2633027,B00CRQL8OW,4,Many duplicate colors but write very nicely. Four Stars
2633028,B00CRQL8OW,5,I bought a set for me and one for my college aged daughter.  We are both doing adult coloring books and these are fantastic. We are both doing adult coloring books and these are fantastic.
2633029,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Wow, what can I say about these. Nice color pay off, neons are extra neon, pastels really pastels and the glitter ones are really pretty. They are really good quality and they are a bargain comparing this kind of set to other ones that have even less colors. Great Pens"
2633030,B00CRQL8OW,5,These pens are great. I love the assortment of colors. Great purchase!
2633031,B00CRQL8OW,2,"wide assortments of colors...good, smooth flow from the pens...BUT pens were inconsistently filled. I received 3 pens with no ink in at all a few filled a 1/4 inch and a few that were generously filled. The company needs to repair the filling station...cause my pens are almost on empty!!!!!! nice pens BUT no pens are inconsistently filled.....a few completely empty!"
2633032,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I'm not new to adult coloring books (or coloring in general) but I haven't used gel pens since I was a kid. So these were my first real experience with them as an adult. (But I have used a bunch of others since.) There are 48 pens in this package including 6 standard, 6 neon, 6 swirl, 12 glitter, 10 metallic and 8 milky colors. So the package does have a decent variety of colors. It's nice to mix a little glitter with some metallic and so forth. I like the variety a lot.

The pens themselves are lovely. There are a lot of colors to choose from and with the different types, you can really make a picture pop. They have a nice tip range as well. I wouldn't recommend gel pens for very large areas but for the smaller spots, these work great. I did notice (with a few pens) that they were either streaky or had difficulty releasing the ink. One of the reasons that I love gel pens is because they glide so smoothly. I find that to be equally as calming as the coloring action itself. So this was a little disappointing. I didn't experience this with all the pens. Just a few duds I suppose.

My favorite in this pack are the glitter and metallic colors. The glitter pens contain a lot of glitter which makes everything look so vibrant and lovely. But be careful with glitter pens as the more glitter they contain, the more likely the ink is to streak- at least in my experience. However, I didn't really have much a problem with these at all. They glided so nicely across the page and they look phenomenal. The metallic ones, despite how absolutely beautiful the colors are, gave me some problems with streakiness. Nothing that I couldn't work with but could be a bit annoying at times.

I am really enjoying these pens. I love the variety and the vibrancy of the colors. I would absolutely purchase these again. It's nice to mix a little glitter with some metallic and ..."
2633033,B00CRQL8OW,4,Very nice assortment of colors but the pens are not very full . Nice

2633042,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I recently decided to take up some adult coloring activities during my limited free time, and purchased these pens.  I have only used them about 4 times, but I really love them!  They all write flawlessly, and immediately after I tried the pens for the first time.  They have a nice fine point, so you can color in even the smallest detail without going outside of the lines.  Very bright and covers evenly without bleeding through.  I read through reviews of tons of different gel pens before settling on these, and they are living up to their reviews for sure!  Will buy more when I run out of the other ones!  Great price for a great quality pen. Lolliz by gollies!  Love them!"
2633043,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I just received this Gel Pen set and though I have not tried out all the colors they are really nice. The colors are beautiful and they draw/write as smooth as butter.
I'm thrilled that I got in on the 'deal' and when I can tear myself away from drawing on my Kindle(s) I will be most anxious to try my hand with these lovely pens.
They are really for anyone-artist, beginning artist, professional, etc.--just a really great deal and a wonderful gel pen! SMOOTH AS SILK AND EASY PEASY TO USE!"

2633057,B00CRQL8OW,5,My girlfriend is really into those adult coloring books so I bought her colored pencil kits and this gel kit for her new hobby. She said that the pens flow smoothly and have great color. Terrific price and you get a lot of different types such as metallic and color changing pens. I was a little hesitant buying these since they cost so little. I didn't want to buy her cheap pens that will ruin her experience but they are very good quality. So many colors
2633058,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Bought these as prizes for students and they love them. They fly out of the treasure chest! They were a great value per pen, so it helped make the purchase a better value. I can't speak to the quality of the pen since I use them only for students' prizes, but they seem to like them a lot! Great Student Prize"
2633059,B00CRQL8OW,4,Even though some don't work you can't beat the price on these. Worth the buy imo! Four Stars
2633060,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love the glitter comes out and on paper amazingly sparkling!, neon, Metallic, and milky all glide on real nice but the swirl and standard like rips the paper up,so there's like a ball of lint on the tip, skips so you have to go over it again. But for the price and the overall quality I would totally buy again. I'm using for my coLoring book and it's way better than colored pencils!! Vibrant bright colors, I give 5 stars. And it doesn't bleed through the paper, also drows pretty quick as I didn't smear at all! awesome pens"
2633061,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Pens arrived in a polyurethane bag with 4 trays of 12 pens. For shipping it is the ideal set-up but a little hard for using/storing the product. There is a plastic band to put the pen caps over but it is situated at the back of the tray as opposed to the front. Still, not a bad storage system.
The pens themselves have brilliant ink that flow smoothly and evenly. I did not notice any smudging or blending of colors if light color placed next to dark. They are the same size as a Bic ball-point pen but with a little less ink. I would order and recommend Lolliz Colored Gel Pens"
2633062,B00CRQL8OW,1,Most of them don't work. Some are dried up and a couple had exploded! Awful

2633071,B00CRQL8OW,5,These gel pens are FABULOUS and you can't beat the price.  I am using them for my adult coloring and the colors are so bright and vivid and do not bleed through the page.  I am so glad I purchased them.  No more colored pencils for me. FABULOUS
2633072,B00CRQL8OW,5,These are very smooth to color with.  I'm only sorry i didn't purchase the 2 pack! great vibrant colors!

2633084,B00CRQL8OW,5,I really love these pens!!! Perfect use for my adult coloring books! Five Stars
2633085,B00CRQL8OW,4,These pens are very good.  They write very smooth with no clumps.  I use them for adult coloring books but they would also be great for just writing.  The multi-colored pens don't work well for coloring as the colors get all muddled. Great gel pens!!
2633086,B00CRQL8OW,4,I am a big gel pen fanatic and always have a lot of them on hand. Lolliz is one of my favorite brands to use for the type of pictures I color.

2633091,B00CRQL8OW,5,Best gel pens for an amazing price. The glitter ones are my favorite. They are perfect for my coloring books ! Best!
2633092,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I got these from my sister, and they work great. I love using them with the adult coloring books. There's a good variety of them. I just purchased another set of them. Amazing price"
2633093,B00CRQL8OW,5,Nice pens for coloring Five Stars
2633094,B00CRQL8OW,5,I love the colors. Five Stars
2633095,B00CRQL8OW,2,I was a Earth Angel and bought for a complete stranger she messaged me stating she loves these pens even though I have been reading and asking around about the quality lay down of these gel pens. Some say they are fine but as time goes on I'm getting feed back about these being scratchy looking on there lay down which NO ONE LIKE.  I don't understand they are up there as one of the best sellers.  If they want stay up there I'd suggest to put quality in the gel pens.to where they have a smooth lay down. Buy color Technik gel pens you will Buy no other ! Scratchy gel pens I've been told more than smooth ! Color Technik are so far the Best out there
2633096,B00CRQL8OW,4,Not bad for the price. Some of them skin- usually when writing on a hard surface. They also in out quickly but for the price they're good. Good considering how inexpensive they are
2633097,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I'm not new to adult coloring books (or coloring in general) but I haven't used gel pens since I was a kid. So these were my first real experience with them as an adult. (But I have used a bunch of others since.) I received these as a gift. I was told that they were reasonably priced and contained a nice variety of colors. There are 48 pens in this package including 6 standard, 6 neon, 6 swirl, 12 glitter, 10 metallic and 8 milky colors. So the package does have a decent variety of colors. It's nice to mix a little glitter with some metallic and so forth. I like the variety a lot.

I was a bit disappointed in the packaging. The box really isn't all that convenient for storage unlike others I have received that had slots for the pens- making putting them away easy. The top (and bottom for that matter) of the box kept opening and the pens kept spilling out. So I just transferred them to a ziploc bag and everything is just fine now. But the packaging, in reality, is not a very big deal.

The pens themselves are lovely. There are a lot of colors to choose from and with the different types, you can really make a picture pop. They have a nice tip range as well. I wouldn't recommend gel pens for very large areas but for the smaller spots, these work great. I did notice (with a few pens) that they were either streaky or had difficulty releasing the ink. One of the reasons that I love gel pens is because they glide so smoothly. I find that to be equally as calming as the coloring action itself. So this was a little disappointing. I didn't experience this with all the pens. Just a few duds I suppose.

My favorite in this pack are the glitter and metallic colors. The glitter pens contain a lot of glitter which makes everything look so vibrant and lovely. But be careful with glitter pens as the more glitter they contain, the more likely the ink is to streak- at least in my experience. However, I didn't really have much a problem with these at all. They glided so nicely across the page and they look phenomenal. The metallic ones, despite how absolutely beautiful the colors are, gave me some problems with streakiness. Nothing that I couldn't work with but could be a bit annoying at times.

Overall, I am really enjoying these pens. I love the variety and the vibrance of the colors. I would absolutely purchase these again. Nice variety!"
2633098,B00CRQL8OW,5,Absolutely love these gel pens. They go on smooth and last a long time. I was skeptical be a use its such a good price but I will be ordering again and seeing if they have a bigger packet available. I use them for adult coloring books. No bleed. Wonderful pens
2633099,B00CRQL8OW,5,Gave a set to my daughter and as a birthday gift. Perfect for first grade girls!!! They loved them. Very happy with our purchase! Great gel pen set!
2633100,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I really like these pens, smooth and lots of colors. However, i could have done without the 5 swirl colors. The swirl colors would be great for kids but totally uesless for my coloring. I really like these pens"
2633101,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I ordered these pens for my 7 y.o. daughter who loves to write stories and draw. Good value, but some of the pens aren't very smooth or don't work at all. Still a good deal for the price, but I may order a different brand next time. Good value, but some of the pens aren't very ..."

2633104,B00CRQL8OW,5,TY Thanks
2633106,B00CRQL8OW,5,I bought there for my 11 year old daughter and she loves them. She loves how there's a huge variety of colors. Will most likely buy again when the ink runs out. Very satisfied with my purchase. Very satisfied with my purchase
2633107,B00CRQL8OW,5,Just starting this venture. Good color assortment Good color
2633108,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Pens came today!! I have the FrogLily set and LOVE them but I wanted some additional colors! These had great ratings so when they got here I couldn't wait to try them! They work GREAT! The tip is slightly bigger than the FrogLily gel pens but they still do the job! FUN having more colors to work with! Just be sure to be patient... I was so excited to get going that I didn't give time to dry and I smeared a small area.. My bad! All gel pens need a bit of time to dry, it wasn't to too long but you do have to wait a little! Pens don't leak out, blot and they write smooth! FUN asset to coloring! Great set, writes smoothly.. Give a little time to dry!"
2633110,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Great pens that remind me of being back in school. I like to use these to accent black and white pen sketches, they really add a pop of color. But you have to be careful because they do smudge easily.  I still have some from back when I was in high school and they do still work. I now use them to make cards or use for my scrapbooks. Some brands work better than others. They write very smooth.... I love these gel pens! They are such great colors  to doodles and embellishments, these are great to add a little color and flair to your pages! I also love using mine to write in cards (thank yous, birthdays, etc.). They do need to dry for a bit before turning pages or putting cards in envelopes, otherwise there will be smudging. Also, as with most gel pens, the ink goes quickly when you're doing big projects. Great pens that remind me of being back in school"
2633111,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I love these pens. The colors are bright, the metallics are sufficiently sparkly, and the ink flows nicely. The swirled color ones have proven to be more annoying than anything else because I grab them thinking they are one color and they aren't.  The plastic box is useless. I just threw mine in a 25 plastic pencil box from Target. I love these pens"
2633112,B00CRQL8OW,4,Good pens but colors all start to look the same. Four Stars
2633114,B00CRQL8OW,5,"So many pretty colors! Excellent value for the money. Got it for DS, who likes to draw and uses all of the colors. Not sure what other uses this kit may have, but I am very pleased with the quality of the pens, the packaging and the variety of colors. Loved it"
2633115,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I LOVE THESE PENS. and they do not run if they get wet. I used one on parchment and copy paper, submerged it in coffee for 3 hours, pulled it out and tried to smear it and nothing did! Colors are VERY bright. Perfect for adult coloring and kid coloring.

2633117,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I really love these Pens. They aren't runny, the caps stay on fine, all of them worked, I love the colors,  and they color smoothly. My only complaint is that they seem to go fast. I still haven't been able to tell if it's gravity or if they are running that low. I took one I used and tipped it right side up when I was done and a lot of the Gel ran to the bottom again. So it didn't seem as empty. I am giving them four stars cause they do go fast. I would buy them again though. I really love these Pens"
2633118,B00CRQL8OW,1,so far at least half of pens were dry. would not buy again
2633119,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these pens Five Stars
2633120,B00CRQL8OW,5,Neat addition to my pens Worth it
2633121,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Received my gel pens today and immediately tested them all.  So pleased.  Colors are vibrant, the ink flows smoothly.  They are comfortable to use.  The only disappointment was the intended use.  I have a journaling bible that I was excited to try the gel pens.  However the pens bleed through.  So I will use them for my coloring books.  I love these pens.  I think they are the best I have purchased - and I have tried many different brands.  One other note - be sure to allow drying time to avoid smearing. Love these pens - best ever."
2633123,B00CRQL8OW,1,"There were only 10-12 that wrote smoothly. Some of them skipped and some scratched up the paper. It looks like a fun mix of colors/effects, but really only the sparkle and the metallic were usable. The milky/pastel colors were especially poor performing and the multicolor mix pens had not only poor ink disbursement but also scratched up the paper. Overall, not worth the money at all! Do not waste your money"
2633124,B00CRQL8OW,5,what I expected Five Stars
2633125,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love them! Will definitely buy some more! Five Stars
2633126,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I was skeptical, given all of the super expensive gel pens out there, about how these would work with my coloring books. They were so cheap, I decided to give them a try anyway. I'm really glad I did. They are very pretty pens and add lots of color to my coloring pages. I love that there are metallic colors included. I would recommend these to anyone looking for gel pens. Don't waste your money on super expensive ones when these work great. Great Gel Pens for Coloring"

2633146,B00CRQL8OW,4,"The pens are a good value.  There were a few more repeats on some of the colors than I was expecting, but still a good value.

2633150,B00CRQL8OW,5,"LolliZ 48 was such a good purchase!!
I tested out the pens before using and got all the ink flow started and have not had a problem with them.  They glide over the paper nicely and I am currently using them in one of my adult sweary coloring books.
Some of the colors seem to be very close in shade to each other like the Neon Orange and Milky Orange however I have found that it also depends on the paper you are using that determines the color shade.  The basic colors did have two colors that were duplicates but that is no big deal as I'm sure they will get used for something at some point.
I am very pleased with the range of color in the 48 pack and am glad that I did not go with a larger pack like I originally wanted. Perfect Range of Colors"
2633151,B00CRQL8OW,5,The best about this gel pens are its effective and colorful too. recommended gel pens for office or school supplies
2633152,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Most of the pens wrote smoothly, but some wouldn't write consistently. Four Stars"
2633153,B00CRQL8OW,4,"You definitely get your money's worth with these pens in sheer volume. Do they work great? Yes. Are they my favorite? No. But sometimes I don't want to spend so much to get Gelly Roll pens. Don't expect these to be of that quality, but for casual use you get a great selection of colors and styles of gel pens for a great price. Great price!"
2633154,B00CRQL8OW,5,These are pretty nice. This is my first time trying them and do enjoy the easy glide of the gel. Very nice
2633155,B00CRQL8OW,4,Nice! Four Stars
2633156,B00CRQL8OW,5,I love these pens! Like others have said the swirls skip a little but the other pens are great. The only issue is a few of the neon colors look identical. Very cool pens!

2633164,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these Five Stars
2633165,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These were the first gel pens I've ever purchased for coloring. The colors were VERY bright and vivid and the glitter pens are super sparkly. The ink flows very nicely and the tip is fine enough to get into those tiny areas of detail. My only complaint is that they are going to run out so quickly. I only used 6 pens for this picture and included the black pen for comparison. You can see how much ink was used on this one picture alone. So I guess I would say use them sparingly? Bright, sparkly colors!"

2633169,B00CRQL8OW,5,"This is a great set of pens!  Its also my third set of gel pens and is equally comparable to others that almost twice the price.  I love that it comes with standard colors, but I really love the fluorescent colors .  This set also has swirl colors which is two colors in one pen, and that is awesome. I started buying gel pens for coloring books, but i love the swirl pens for notes, cards, etc.  These are great for coloring books- the don't bleed through the paper (although that depends on the paper) and they are smooth to use.  I ordered these and they were delivered and several pens were damaged and not usable.  Return and exchange was super easy and a replacement was send super fast.  I will buy these again. awesome to use and great value"

2633186,B00CRQL8OW,2,"I was very disappointed in these Gel pens.  I bought them when they were on sale 2 boxes for the price of one or something similar and I'm sorry I did.  The colors are brilliant but some of the pens skip and some tear up the pages while I'm coloring.  Some pens you have to pre-prime by scribbling back and forth on a page for the colors to start to run.  Some didn't run even after that trick. It's hard to tell which pens are the glitter pens as there are only a few sprinkles on the outside of the pen to give you a hint and once colored, you don't really see the glitter.  The six pens that are called ""swirl"" just turn into muddy looking colors.  I really wish I had bought more of the Gelly Roll pens.  I now have two boxes of these pens that I don't want to use!  The biggest problem with these pens is they skip.  You can color until you are blue in the face, but you can still see the areas they skipped on the page. They are good enough for children but if you want really nice looking pages that are colored, suitable for framing, I'd use a different brand.  I hate giving bad reviews on a product, but feel I should tell it like it is and maybe keep someone else from making the same mistake. Thumbs down."

2633202,B00CRQL8OW,4,Great selection of colors.  Especially like the sparke and Matt colors.  Most work well.  They seem to run out of ink pretty fast or I'm coloring a lot. Nice selection of colors

2633206,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I'm enjoying using my LolliZ. They go on smooth without streaks or build-up, don't bleed through paper (even cheap copy paper), dry quickly so there's no smearing and no waiting. Definitely a good buy. Definitely a good buy."
2633207,B00CRQL8OW,4,My granddaughters need gel pens to draw with during art class! These were great! My grandkids love them! These were great! My grandkids love them

2633213,B00CRQL8OW,5,Very pleased with purchase. Five Stars
2633214,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Perfect for those fine lines on my adult coloring books, the milky colors flow so well and love the glitter ones too! Wonderful, rich colors"
2633215,B00CRQL8OW,5,These are fun to color with. I even received an email with free coloring pages. Nice
2633216,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Nice selection but they do streak. I found going in circles instead of ""lines"" help to prevent them from not filling in all the way so to say as they not really what I say streak but leave line marks. Nice selection but they do streak"
2633217,B00CRQL8OW,4,Purchased two as gifts. They loved them. Great price.
2633218,B00CRQL8OW,2,"some of the pens do not work, just ok, not great Two Stars"
2633219,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Great quality and nice rage of colors for the price. I especially like the milky colors. These gel pens sometimes leave the paper looking a little scratchy if you try to color quickly with them. They look best when used slowly to allow more ink to flow out. They come with plenty of ink and none of them were damaged. The orange milky and orange neon colors look identical on paper. I also dislike the swirl pens as I use these for coloring and have no use for a pen that can change color at any moment. But they are still good quality and may be useful to someone else. The swirl pens have the same ink in them as the milky pens. If you are looking for decent quality, affordable gel pens then this set is a fine choice. If you can spend more, the Sakura brand Gelly Roll gel pens write more smoothly and come in some unique colors. But these are a fraction of the price of the Gelly Roll pens and are a great starting point. Definitely worth the price"
2633220,B00CRQL8OW,5,Nice and juicy and beautiful but hit them with a heat gun as you are working..they stay wet pretty long and smear easily if you don't. The end result is worth that little extra effort. Nice and juicy and beautiful but hit them with a ...

2633222,B00CRQL8OW,4,good Four Stars
2633223,B00CRQL8OW,2,I found more than two of the pens were busted and most of the ink leaked out of the rear of the pen when I opened the box. Useless set now. Buyer Beware-- poorly made and item NOT checked prior to being shipped
2633225,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I ordered these pens to color in my adult coloring book and so far I couldn't be happier. The ink goes on smooth even the glitter ones. The neon ones for me seem to be the ones that pool the ink or take longer to dry so I smudged those a time or two.  A good set for the price, a good variety of colors Great for coloring"

2633227,B00CRQL8OW,5,Excellent Item and Great Service..!! Five Stars
2633229,B00CRQL8OW,5,Just received these and tried them immediately and they glide like butter. Beautiful colors. Great price.. Would definitely order again. Great Gel Pens
2633230,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These pens have a wide range of beautiful colors. I use them for adult coloring books and for the most part they work well. The swirl colors haven't been very useful for me because there really isn't much swirling of colors and they tend to look muddled. Some of the pen tips seem to stick and don't apply the ink evenly. Other than that, I think they were a good buy and I have gotten a lot of use from them. Beautiful colors"
2633231,B00CRQL8OW,5,Nice writing and great deal. Gel sells
2633232,B00CRQL8OW,1,Bad product ran out of ink to wuick One Star
2633233,B00CRQL8OW,5,I bought these to adult color and they are perfect for it! I really love how bright the colors are and how pretty the glitter one are. I will be buying again! Great for adult coloring!
2633234,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Smooth lines, sharp colors, only wish is for more colors Five Stars"
2633235,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great pin set for 12-year-old girls who like to color. Works really well with the adult coloring books. The sparkly colors really look cool. Great pin set for 12-year-old girls who like to color
2633236,B00CRQL8OW,5,I bought these to doodle with and work with on my postcards I create. They came just as pictured in 4 trays inside the box . It is a great set and the price is very reasonable. I will definitely order these again if needed. I have only two complaints. These don't have a single white marker in the set. Also several of the markers are multi-color ink in one pen. I never have liked those kind. But they do roll well and work great. Great set wonderful colors.
2633237,B00CRQL8OW,4,Great color but they 'leak' and the caps do not stay on Good but
2633238,B00CRQL8OW,2,Come work some don't some colors are repeats . Shipping is good fast Had to try
2633239,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Nice Pens for coloring.  I got my set and am generally pleased.  The metalics and sparkly pens really pop.  Down side are the ""swirled"" pens... are somewhat muddy when using them and I personally don't like when I pick it up am not sure what color is going to come out of it.  I would have been happier if it did not have those pens in there , and rather had a true red in this pack.  Would be super great if a gel set contained some ""flesh"" toned pens.  But overall a really great buy to get over 40 pens that work well, don't bleed or run for the price.  Would buy again when they run out. Nice Pens for coloring"
2633240,B00CRQL8OW,4,Great set for a great price. Ended up buying several as gifts to go with adult coloring books since they worked so well and are nicer than colored pencils Great set for a great price
2633241,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I purchased these gel pens to use for adult coloring books.  There is a great variety of colors, and I have had no issues with coverage or the flow of the ink.  Nice colors, and I'm very glad I purchased them. There is a great variety of colors"
2633242,B00CRQL8OW,5,Got these for a friend and she liked them so much that she ordered a 96 piece set of them so she had more colors and had a gift for her friend. Great deal
2633243,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Wonderful color selection.  There are several ""multi colored"" pens that I do not like in this bunch.  You can't judge by the pen cap what color will come out so I constantly have to have a tester paper handy. Lovely sparkly colors."
2633244,B00CRQL8OW,4,Really nice colors and easier to use vs. markers. Four Stars
2633245,B00CRQL8OW,4,Great gel pens.  Enjoy using them. Nice pens!
2633246,B00CRQL8OW,5,My 11 year old daughter loves them. Good quality too. Good

2633248,B00CRQL8OW,4,"got these to use with the adult coloring books and they work pretty great, the pastels and swirl pens do not. I ended up giving them to my toddler to try and scribble with and he got frustrated with it and threw them somewhere. I used up a lot of the metallics and sparkle gels though, they work really great and glide well on the paper. I could use a big box of those actually instead of the pastel and swirls they put in the pack. Still, a good value for them because I see so many for sale that are more expensive for less pens. They are not full of ink though. each one shows about half or a little over half filled with the ink so I went through them rather quickly ... use with the adult coloring books and they work pretty great, the pastels and swirl pens do not"
2633249,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Not thrilled with these pens at all.  They skip alot, the flow of ink is hit or miss, some just don't work very well at all......  won't buy again Not thrilled with these pens at all. They skip ..."
2633250,B00CRQL8OW,4,Great pens for use in adult coloring books! Worked well for me.
2633251,B00CRQL8OW,5,"96 pens for the price I would have paid for 24? That alone was enough to make me try these... and they were more than worth it! They write well, smooth, and clean the ink doesn't jump or skip (except for one single milky pen that just wouldn't change colors)... I will be buying these again 96 pens for the price I would have paid for ..."
2633252,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great for coloring or just writing on cards, etc. Five Stars"
2633253,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Overall, they do really well. Some of the pens are great! Some run a little too much (about 3) and other colors don't work at all (about 2-3). There are also some dual colored pens in the pack that can either look like mud when they come out or a cool psychedelic color. I use them on my adult coloring books for about 30 minutes 4 times a week :-). I would definitely get them again if they were a reasonable price. They also seem like they will last me a long time. Would buy again"
2633254,B00CRQL8OW,5,Thank you! Five Stars
2633255,B00CRQL8OW,5,These remind me of when i was in middle school when gel pens were cool . I bought these for my daughters projects and im very pleased with these pens . They work very nicely and make great pictures . Great product
2633256,B00CRQL8OW,5,This was a Lightening Deal - Great price!  Excellent selection of colors.  I use these with Adult Coloring books and the completed pages look amazing. Great for use with Adult Coloring books!
2633257,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These are so awesome...so many different choices of color quality. Great flow, but since they are gel, they do not last long. Great value for the price. These are so awesome.."
2633258,B00CRQL8OW,5,Just what I wanted. Five Stars
2633259,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Every pen in this set works beautifully.  No skipping, only smooth writing.  The colors are vibrant and sparkly.  My kids love using these pens for drawing, writing and coloring.  What a great deal for so many great pens! Every pen in this set works beautifully. No skipping"

2633261,B00CRQL8OW,5,Excellent bright colors Five Stars
2633262,B00CRQL8OW,5,omg i love these are so smooth wow
2633263,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love this packet of gel pens but would like it even better without the neons and the swirl pens.  More basic colors would be appreciated as those are the ones that I ran out of first. I also find that I don't use the blacks, grey or white pens for my adult coloring books.  Maybe if enough people feel the same way that I do, the LolliZ company will create a different variety of colors to pick from and leave the neons and swirls completely out of the mix. More primary colors please...."
2633264,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Some ppl complained of another brand having duplicates that did not for me but this pack did. 2 black for one! That was disappointing. But they write well except for the lighter, or milky, colors. Also, could do without the swirl pens that when working properly turns brown!!!! I bought it on a lightning deal so the price was right. Some ppl complained of another brand having duplicates that did ..."
2633265,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These pens are awesome! Every color, standard ,swirl, neon, glitter, metallic and acid free. I love to color it de-stresses me. Until I found this set it was hard to find pens to color with that I liked. The sets come in trays that stack in the package. So when I want to color I lay them out. Putting them away is a breeze even if your other hand is full. They don't bleed or smear, which is a plus in my book :)If you like to color, you won't be disappointed buying these.. I am very happy purchasing these. Awesome colors!"
2633266,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Nice quality. There are 2-3 duplicate colors and the ""milky"" ones are a blend of colors-some of which are only in these pens when they should also have thier own solid color pen. Other than that they are great, most write very smooth and the glitter colors super sparkle in the right light. Over all they are for sure worth the price. Nice quality. There are 2-3 duplicate colors and the ..."
2633267,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These pens are great for the price....if you aren't too particular about colors. For instance, my set came with 3neon (hunter) orange &no regular orange. No regular brown or any in the brown 'family'. Do they not exist in gel pens? No red in my set either. They work fine, though, no complaints there. I recommend these if you are on a strict budget, &, aren't particular about creating lifelike images. I will search on for more lifelike colors...perhaps I must move on to watercolors or oil pastels... Anyway good bundle for the price. Good for the price"
2633268,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I REALLY like the glitter pens. I wish I could get a set of different colors of just the glitter pens.  There were a few duplicate pens which was disappointing. The ""milky"" pens are quite useless. The metallic pens are ok. I have figured out how to use them without getting ""lines"" showing while coloring. If it wasn't for the glitter pens, this would be a 2-3 star rating. The glitter pens really make a difference. I wish they came in more colors! Ok"
2633269,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love these pens. Now I may do justice to my adult coloring book. Love, love, love"
2633270,B00CRQL8OW,5,This is my first experience with gel pens and I am enjoying them much more than the pencils that came with my coloring book.  The variety of colors is nice.  They are best for small detail work. The variety of colors is nice. They are best for small detail work
2633272,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Love these pens, so much fun especially the glitter.  Only ones I don't like are the multicolor; sent them to my Granddaughter and she loves them. Love these pens"
2633274,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great pens, they work well.  Good color selection.  I personally would prefer to have six more additional solid colors instead of swirls, but that is my personal preference.  I suppose there are those that like swirls, which is why they are included, but I can't see a place to put them in my art. They go down smoothly on paper.  I have not noticed any bleed through, but most of the paper I have used, has not been really thin. Great buy"
2633275,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love the colors very fine point Five Stars
2633276,B00CRQL8OW,5,I bought these for my daughter to use to color with and she loves them!  The colors are bright and brilliant and they write and draw smoothly.  Would definitely recommend! Excellent Pens!

2633280,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great! The kids use these for their coloring books, and I use them for grading papers in fun colors. Great purchase! Great! The kids use these for their coloring books"
2633281,B00CRQL8OW,5,"My wife bought one pack of these and loved them so much that a week later she bought two more. She had never used gel pens before using these and said that the colors are vivid, they write smoothly,  and her favorites are the milky and glitter pens. She uses them for her adult coloring books and says that she highly recommends them. She's the artist in the family, so I just go with what she says ;) Highly recommended!"
2633282,B00CRQL8OW,5,I love the bright colors and they are fun to use for my adult coloring books. The pictures look really nice. Gel pens look great.
2633284,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Absolutely love these pens. They are beautiful. I ended up buying a pack for my mother as well. There are a few repeat colors, but that's alright because I would still buy the pack again. I use these pens to color in some of my adult coloring books. That is the only thing I use them for and my pictures turn out beautifully. Absolutely love these pens"
2633286,B00CRQL8OW,5,LolliZ is one of my favorite brands of gel pens. They are always smooth and vibrant and what a terrific choice of colors in this pack of 48. They do not dry up as quickly as some brands. I can accidentally leave the lid off and it will still write smoothly. Love LolliZ! Always Smooth and Vibrant!!!
2633287,B00CRQL8OW,5,Bright & Beautiful! Love them!!! Five Stars
2633288,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Yes they're nice pens, but they get lost really easily and see of mine broke in my backpack. they also need a more efficient way to be packed in that box. Four stars"
2633289,B00CRQL8OW,5,Nice set. Nice
2633290,B00CRQL8OW,4,"It's a nice set of gel pens. I didn't think I'd have any use for the swirl pens, but they are nice for subtle effects while coloring. You should keep plain paper handy for testing before using them so you have an idea what you'll get when you use the swirl pens. The rest of the pens are very similar to other gel pens I've used. Nice set."
2633292,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love them plan on rebuying be sure you take the back off look from the top down to check ink level on the swirls I used them so fast it didn't have time to catch up  write smooth so pretty Love them plan on rebuying be sure you take the ...
2633293,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love these pens and how they look on the picture,these are the best. Great gel pens"
2633294,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love these gel pens!  Great variety of colors...glitter, metallic, pastel, bold.  Definitely recommend these. Great variety of pens!"
2633295,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Nice pens. Great pigmentation & ink flow. No skipping. no duplicates, but not a great color variation. More like one package with different types of pens & would be great if that's what you're looking for. This has  6 standard, 6 neon, 6 swirl, 12 glitter, 10 metallic, 8 milky. So if you're coloring, it doesn't give you a great variety that will work together within the same picture, and the swirl are useless for coloring as sometime the blending from two colors is unappealing grey/brown that you get when neon green & pink blend together. not necessarily the best set for coloring"
2633296,B00CRQL8OW,5,Purchased these to add to my collection of coloring items and I'm absolutely obsessed! There are many more colors than I had expected and they roll on the paper perfectly! The glittery ones also don't get glitter all over you! I would definitely buy these again as soon as mine run out in a week! Perfect for adult coloring books!
2633297,B00CRQL8OW,5,Loved them Five Stars
2633298,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I bought these because I decided to get on the coloring bandwagon. I also draw quite extensively. I really wanted a wide-variety of gel pen colors, and I was pretty impressed with these.

The pens themselves are easy to grip, meaning they don't leave those annoying lines in my fingers. I have arthritis, so, it's important that I have comfortable pens. More importantly, the ink writes super smooth. I had to scribble for maybe a second to get each pen to work, which to me, is not very long.

I was a little irked that some of the pens were those annoying change colors pends, meaning the pens have multiple colors in the ink. I didn't feel I was truly getting 48 colors, but for this price I let it slide. Also, the quality of the ink really made me happy with my purchase.

I didn't really get any bleeding through the pages of my coloring book. Now, this is because the pages are pretty thick, so don't expect to be using a super thin piece of paper and not have some bleed through.

The ink does need a few seconds to dry or there will be some smudges.

I definitely loved this product. Good quality gel pens"
2633299,B00CRQL8OW,5,these are the 2nd time I have ordered these - we love them - great colors - great quality ... the 2nd time I have ordered these - we love them - great colors - great
2633300,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Purchased to use on coloring books that have fine details and lines. I've never used this type of pen for art, but these got great reviews, so I went for it. Very sorry I did.

PRO: Highly vivid ink color that won't bleed thru decent quality paper. They're inexpensive.

CON: Terrible mix of colors (6 grey/black, 5 purple, 8 blue, 6 green, 6 yellow/brown, 4 orange, 7 pink/red, 5 multi-color swirl). Several duplicate colors. Swirl pens are useless if you're wanting a specific color. Application is either scratchy or blobby... sometimes both from the same pen. Very few ""natural"" colors.

Granted, I'm not familiar with gel pens, so maybe these are par for the course, but they are definitely not for me. Will most likely be going in the trash soon. Not what I hoped for."
2633301,B00CRQL8OW,4,Arrived fast and nice set for price! Would buy again
2633302,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These pens are excellent! There's no skipping like surg other gel pens I've tried! The only issue I had, was one of the pens broke in shipment and is unusable. These pens are excellent! There's no skipping like surg other gel pens ..."
2633303,B00CRQL8OW,5,love them Five Stars
2633305,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I ordered these gel pens expecting perfection and that is exactly what I received.  They are smooth and easy to use.  The ink comes out easily without force, the colors are beautiful.  I would recommend these pens. They are smooth and easy to use"
2633306,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love these for coloring my pictures. They work nice and smoothly, and look great on the pictures
This is important since I give mine as gifts. love these"
2633307,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great pens for the adult colorist.  They work great with any of the many books you can get.  Comfortable grips and great colors. Great pens for the adult colorist
2633309,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I got these pens on a great lightning deal: $10.99 for 48 pens! I just received them last night and tested them out and, so far, I really enjoy them. They are great for coloring detailed images and most are very smooth. I enjoyed layering the colors for more variation in my coloring book picture (see attached). The swirls were the hardest to swatch since the colors are not all that blended in the barrel.
There are only a couple of negatives to this set:
(1) There are duplicates (see the colors circled in my swatch image) - 2 blacks & 2 blues (standard set) and 2 pinks & 2 oranges (milky set).
(2) The milky colors are kind of scratchy, not very smooth. I thought I would like these the most but they're just not that great. I really prefer the pastel Uniball Signo UM120 pens (but they cost a LOT more than these). Plus, there were 2 colors with duplicates so I really only got 6 colors instead of 8.
(3) I don't get the point of the swirls. They have different colored caps but the ink colors are pretty well the same in the barrel (just different order) and it will take a lot of writing/coloring to get the color to change much. The pens with blue, green and purple caps have the same ink colors (blue, green & purple inks sort of swirled). The other 3 pens have sort of unique ink color swirls but still very similar. All of these swirl pens are kind of scratchy and hard to get going. I would rather just use the other pens and layer them to get variation.
Overall, I'm happy with these pens and you really can't beat the deal. I paid almost $3 each (and $12 for 8 pack) for the Uniball ones I mentioned above. These pens worked out to 23 cents each! I really cannot complain about that! Great deal!"
2633310,B00CRQL8OW,5,"This is my first set of gel pens and I have to say I'm quite impressed. We have an older family member living with us who was spending her time passively watching old movies on TV. I thought that we should try to get her more engaged and using her mind a bit more, so I bought these pens and an adult coloring book as an experiment. So far, so good. She is content to watch me color the pages but enjoys choosing the colors that I use. Needless to say, this has resulted in some rather surreal looking pictures, flowers that could never be found on this planet, and so on.

The pens, so far, are wonderful. they all write smoothly and easily cover the paper. The color selection is fairly good. The glitter inks are quite interesting looking and the neon are fun. My only complaint is that it would be nice to have some obvious primary and secondary colors and, more importantly, some earth tone inks.

For a first time experience, this has been a pretty good one. I'd recommend these pens to anyone. Great set of gel pens!"

2633312,B00CRQL8OW,5,Gift for my daughter who uses it for her adult coloring books.. Loves them.. Five Stars
2633313,B00CRQL8OW,1,"I don't understand all the great reviews for this pen set, maybe I received a defected set, but the problem I have with these pens are most of them are skippy and scratchy when trying to color with them, literally scratching the paper as I go, and no, I'm not applying much pressure, not smooth flowing at all. If you're looking to use for coloring, I would try another brand, maybe for writing and note taking they will do but not for coloring. I will not be purchasing again. Not pleased"

2633315,B00CRQL8OW,1,These leaked the first time I opened them. The colors were great but the mess was awful. The only reason I gave 1 star is that you have to in order to write a review. The colors were great but the mess was awful

2633322,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These are the best gel pens on the market!  Upon arrival every one of the pens worked perfectly, no skipping or clumping, just perfectly smooth lines.  I received these about three weeks ago and have been using them in adult coloring books on a regular basis so the durability factor is unknown for now.  Currently, they are all working to perfection.  The ink laydown seems to be spot on for every pen, I have not had a skip yet which is unbelievable.  I have other gel pens but they seems to skip or clump and you have to work to get a clean line, not with these.  Maybe my set is an abnormality but because of their performance, I'll be getting more of these.  You cannot beat the price of these when you compare them against the competition.  I purchased these with my own money and did not receive a discount or review request from the manufacturer, I just wanted to share my honest opinion of what I believe to be the best gel pens out there. The Best Gel Pens!"
2633323,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great pens for adult coloring books. Love them Super Great Pens
2633324,B00CRQL8OW,5,Good selection of colors. Very easy to use. Fun set

2633326,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Consistency of pens varies. Still, better than the colored pencils. I will order some more. Start coloring!"
2633328,B00CRQL8OW,5,These work awesome! They're so fun to use on adult coloring books. Awesome pens!
2633329,B00CRQL8OW,4,"My friend bought the Fiskar gel pens and I bought these, and they are EXACTLY the same. Same packaging, pens, colors. So you should buy whichever are cheaper. The glitter and metallic colors are awesome. The milky colors tend to not flow as well, but I would still buy these again. Good value for the price. Great for the price"
2633330,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love this for coloring in my new books, and they do not bleed though paper like other markers I've bought and I ruin one page by having markers bleed, great bright colors, love the glitter ones, not real shiny, but has just enough shine to it...great set of markers will buy again for sure... Love this for coloring in my new books"
2633331,B00CRQL8OW,5,A must have. Beautiful colors great value. Beautiful colors great value
2633332,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These gel pens are really all you need to start a coloring adventure. There are 8 each of glitter, metallic, a pastel and a basic 8 collection. The favorite colors (for me anyway)--red, green, blue can be used up way before the others so I actually bought several sets so I'd always have those basics on hand. But with Amazon's 2-day delivery, no one has to be out of anything for very long. And just to be safe AND for a little more variety, other smaller sets are available (of primary, glitter & just about any color combination you need). Shop carefully for the best price, however; you'll find everything from ""Wow, that's great"" to ""Give me a break."" Just sayin'. Great pen set!"
2633333,B00CRQL8OW,4,Enjoy the trays they were in. Makes it easy to get to them. Four Stars

2633336,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Great variety of colors! However, they aren't the smoothest gel pens I've used, and sometimes you have to color over the same area a few times to get a solid coat of color. I've noticed this happens more frequently with the metallic colors, and less often with the glitter & milky colors. All in all, a good set of gel pens for the money. 4 stars. Great variety of colors"
2633337,B00CRQL8OW,5,Excellent selection for a very reasonable price. I'm new to gel pens and these will be ordered again as they've been wonderful to color and design with.! Excellent selection for a very reasonable price

2633344,B00CRQL8OW,5,These pens are amazing and got them a such a great deal. I love gel pens and these are so nice and smooth only problem I've encountered is the silver will cover lines and my baby blue gel pen is almost out after three uses and I only used is on small bubbles and the ink exploded at the end of it. But other than that these gel pens are a great buy These pens are amazing and got them a such a great deal
2633345,B00CRQL8OW,4,Good colors provided. Vibrant for sure. Some colors are tiny variations of each other but still look great. Makes drawings pop. Good colors provided

2633347,B00CRQL8OW,5,My wife loves these for coloring.  Smooth writing for such an inexpensive pen set. Really good assortment of colors and styles.  Only knock is the packaging doesn't make for a great holder/organizer since the pens don't stay in place the greatest. Not a big issue though for such a great value. Great value. Perfect for coloring.

Super smooth, doesn't leave obvious line marks while coloring with, work great for writing on all sorts of surfaces. So wonderful, in fact, already in my cart for my next purchase are two more sets of these!
**one complaint, while there's an array of different styles and colors, the orange neon, pastel, and classic are all the same ink. At least in this box. Other than that, I most definitely recommend these for any art escapades one might be planning on! Pretty darn close to perfect!"
2633357,B00CRQL8OW,5,Very nice Five Stars

2633359,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I recently started utilizing adult coloring books, and decided that gel pens would be a nice option.  These gel pens are a nice addition to my coloring arsenal.  Nice assortment of colors that glide nicely.  I would recommend these to anyone else looking to add gel pens to their coloring arsenal. Nice set!"
2633360,B00CRQL8OW,5,Fun colors!  the quality of the gen pens is excellent.  The ink comes out just right. Great gel pens!
2633361,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Ran out of my last gel pens & found these.  The pens are slimmer than the previous ones I had so there's less ink in them.  Other than that, the nib is fine for getting into the tinier details of what I'm coloring & the ink flow is fluid, not clumpy & hasn't clogged.  Would purchase again. Nice"
2633362,B00CRQL8OW,5,Using them for coloring:) they do a great job! ) they do a great job!
2633364,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I love gel pens! 3rd grade me would be very proud! So many colors and styles. Not a day has passed by where I haven't used the same color twice...yet! They're so bright and you can use them for almost anything!
My only complaints are when you write on paper, it doesn't really bleed through, but it's enough to where you can see it in the back of the paper so when I write in the back it just looks like scribbles. So, I can only use certain colors for school.
Also, the 'swirl' style skips a lot and it's very irritating when writing so I stopped using those.
After writing for two and half pages, front and back, more than half the ink is gone which is expected since they waste a lot of ink when writing or drawing.
But overall for like $15 for 48 pens is quite the deal! I still enjoy them. Never a dull day in school!"
2633365,B00CRQL8OW,4,Love all the different colors Four Stars
2633366,B00CRQL8OW,4,I like them just fine.  My first time use of gel pens for coloring.  Fun and nice bright colors. Four Stars
2633367,B00CRQL8OW,4,The gel pens are good but there are a few of them that are hard to get the ink out of.  I have to scribble on a piece of paper or press down on the point to get them to write smoothly. The gel pens are good but there are a few of them that are ...

2633375,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great assortment of colors, kids love it! Five Stars"
2633376,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Great colors but some aren't writing as smooth as I would like. I don't like having to go over the same spot over and over because I use these on adult coloring books and sometimes it makes it look messy and uneven. Otherwise, they're pretty good for the quantity and colors offered for the price. PRETTY GOOD!!"

2633381,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Love this set! The flow of ink is great from them.  Very similar to the other set we own, Fiskars brand.  The only drawback in my opinion is that I wish there were more basic colors available.  Lots of specialties.  I would purchase them again. Great set of gel pen!"
2633382,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love these :) I found a bunch of coloring books that I really wanted but didn't want to use crayons or colored pencils. Lucky me, I found these! All different colors, great for coloring awesome gel pens"
2633383,B00CRQL8OW,2,I was looking forward to having some great gel pens for my coloring. When I received my pens I found that none of the yellow or orange pens work correctly. They were either very runny or didn't work at all. I also had trouble with all of the neon pens being very runny. I didn't return these as the metals and glitters are great. Wish I had purchased something different.
2633384,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I'm pleased with them so far. I like all the colors except the 6 swirl colors. I haven't tried any other brands yet.  I would probably buy them again, they seem like a good value. Pleased so far"
2633385,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these pens!  They write smoothly and the colors are brighter than the pen! Five Stars
2633386,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Nice selection of colors and types.  There are metallic, glo colors and the glitter colors are the best I have seen anywhere.  Very good buy. Nice selection of colors and types"
2633387,B00CRQL8OW,5,Where have these pens been all my life?  Wish I had these to doodle and color with when I was a kid.  Ordered these along with an adult coloring book.  The color goes on smooth and soft and doesn't smear.  It's like being able to paint very fine details without the hassle of a tiny brush and paint. Incredible.
2633388,B00CRQL8OW,4,I wish there were more light soft colors. A lot of the colors are look very similar & dark Four Stars
2633389,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great quality and lots of variety for the price.  Works great on my ""adult"" coloring books.  No issues with globs forming or leaky pens.
The set includes: 6 standard, 6 neon, 6 swirl, 12 glitter, 10 metallic, 8 milky. They have a Transparent outer shell for easy browsing and access to the large color variety.
The 0.8-1.0mm tip range enhances contact with paper for a smooth glide and better hold of ink on the paper's surface

2633394,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love these...got them on sale, then shortly after they went on a 2 for one sale.  If you love brilliant color you will love these.  I even like the glitter ones and I am not a glitter person.  Super for mandala work and best of all they don't bleed through the paper.  The only ones I have not used are the swirls, but maybe some day... I designed and colored this mandala...posting it so you can see the vivid colors. Just what I hoped they would be"
2633395,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great quality, writes very smooth, vibrant colors. Perfect for my 12 year old!"
2633396,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These gel pens are great! They are very smooth and great quality for the price! When I first became interested in destressing a bit with some good old fashion coloring books I looked everywhere in the stores for a good set of gel pens. I didn't find any sets that came with more than 4 or 5 very expensive pens and they were all just the basic colors. Then it dawned on me that, duh, Amazon has everything! Low and behold, I now own a great set of 48 gel pens at an amazing price! I even bought a set for my friend for her birthday and she loves them!! They also do great on different kinds of paper! Not all of my coloring books have the same grade of paper and these gel pens work amazingly well on all of them! Would definitely recommend these to anyone! Great pens and a great price!!"
2633397,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These are the best Gel pens I have tried to date...smooth, bright colors that lay on the paper nicely...no bleed through!  Highly recommend, I am buying a second set for my grand daughter! Excellent gel pens at a great price! m"
2633398,B00CRQL8OW,5,Loved them. Would order again. Five Stars
2633399,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Great price; just 6 or 8 pens are this much in stores!  Considering the price, I'm okay with a few pens being difficult to write with, possibly a bit dry.  I can already see which pens are my favorite (glitter & metallic) and which ones I'll be giving away (swirl & standard).  I enjoy layering these over markers, for a solid base color with shimmer ontop.

At this price I can throw them down at weekly Family Dinners and not worry about my nieces & sons abusing them.  Instead, I cam focus on enjoying time spent coloring the detailed coloring books which are so popular! Exceptional Value"
2633400,B00CRQL8OW,4,Nice variety of colors and they work well.  I've purchased several sets as gifts too and we have been very happy with them. Nice variety of colors and they work well
2633401,B00CRQL8OW,4,Love the variety of colors. A couple pens were unusable as they just would not write. The rest are super. Love the variety of colors

2633404,B00CRQL8OW,5,Very nice pens they are rich in color and flows nice Five Stars
2633405,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Very nice colors.  Some flow much smoother than others.  Any project that requires a larger area to fill in runs thru the ink pretty quickly, I was using them to color with.  Probably not the best choice to color with, better suited for smaller projects.  Would recommend, seems like a good value. Nice variety"
2633406,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Love these pens! The only reason I gave them 4 stars instead of five is because the swirl pens are crappy, and 2 or 3 of the pens were only halfway full of ink, but it is still a great value for the money even with those two issues. The metallic and glitter ones are really pretty, and they are perfect for adult coloring! Love these pens"
2633407,B00CRQL8OW,5,bright colors. love it love
2633408,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I am just getting into the whole adult coloring craze and was looking for some good gel pens. These are really good except for the fact that after I colored one picture where I mainly used three colors, the pens were almost empty. I know they aren't supposed to last forever but I did think I would get more out of them than that. On the other hand, they go on great, not a lot of smearing. That part I love. Good quality for the price."

I don't know if I got a bad batch but many (possibly over half) skip, scratch or the ink just simply will not flow.  I am extremely disappointed and will probably return them.  The pens that work best are the glitter.  Even the metallic goes down well but I noticed as I was continuing to color the page that the metallic areas were either flaking or fading.  I personally would not recommend this set.  It's sad though because the pens that work are super and just the fine line I need for some of my adult coloring books. ... am a gel pen fanatic and with all the great reviews I had to try these"

2633430,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Ok, I really really like these pens -- honestly I like the Gelly Roll pens better for writing, but if you want a gel pen for coloring, the Lolliz pens have a finer point, which works better in small spaces. My only complaint is I got duplicates of three of the pens (they're not just a different ink type, they're straight-up duplicates), which was rather disappointing. But, for the price you can't beat them. Love the pens, but got three duplicate colors"

2633440,B00CRQL8OW,1,I did a lot of looking before I bought this product. Many people mentioned great response and smooth writing. I received these pens and immediately went to writing with them and using them for the adult coloring book I bought. Most of the pens are dry and have terrible responses. I actually tore a page while coloring because of this. I'm very disappointed in this product. I will not be buying anymore of these pens. Many people mentioned great response and smooth writing

2633444,B00CRQL8OW,2,"These pens seem so scratchy and they skip when trying to use them for drawing or journaling. The ink colors are nice, so if you're only using them for coloring where you don't need a smooth line I guess they'd be fine. Far from a joy to use however. The swirl colors can sometimes end up looking muddy, as when green and purple mix into a gross brownish color. If they weren't so cheap I'd just send them back and splurge for the Gelly Roll pens that at least I know are nice to use. The ink colors are nice, so if you're only using them for coloring ..."

2633447,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Love these.  They write smooth and color into fine areas easily. My only compliant is that inside the box, it is like getting 4 different theme color boxes; and 2 of them are identical colors on the paper even though they gave them different color style caps. So I have duplicate colors.  There are still a lot of color choices but if I had known that I probably would have gone with the less pricy box of 48 pens which doesn't have repeat colors and works as nice. Good but too many repeat colors in the box."
2633448,B00CRQL8OW,2,"My granddaughter just used these for the first time. So far 4 of them are all dried up and won't write.

These are a great add to the other gel pens that I already have. When these run out, I would definitely purchase again. Nice pens"

2633455,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love these pens I am on my 4th set! They are smooth and pretty, I recommend them! Five Stars"
2633456,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love Them! Five Stars
2633457,B00CRQL8OW,5,"The pens do fantastic for fine detail in adult coloring books. There is a nice assortment of glitter, metallic, neon and regular. The black sparkling gel pen was a bonus I wasn't expecting. Price was fantastic and much better than the sets I bought at Michael's for a much higher price. Do it."
2633459,B00CRQL8OW,5,These pens are amazing. First time using gel pens and I was instantly hooked on them. Use them for coloring () and for work etc. Very smooth and have held up very well. Love these pens!!!!!
2633460,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Wow. Love these gel pens!  I was given one of the new coloring books with all of the crazy designs and needed some gel pens to make the color pop out.  These pens have been great. I love all of the colors. There is neon, glitter, and more.  I have recommended this product to several other friends and they have also bought the pens and have loved them. Great gel pens."
2633461,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I have been playing with these today, coloring in a doodle drawing. I can tell little difference in 3 of the Orange pens, and 2 of the Pink seem nearly identical as well.  This is not a problem necessarily. I had to get a few of them 'started' on a scrap paper but they all seem to work beautifully. I am not completely sure of the 'swirl' pens, it really takes quite some time to get from the first color to the second so attempting gradation would only be possible with a quite large area. Nice set of gel pens"
2633463,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Great color, goes on easily, saturates nicely without bleed. Ink runs out too quickly though. Four Stars"
2633464,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I am 37 years young and I wanted these so bad.  Finally decided on this set and couldn't be happier.  Got this and a coloring calendar, and I feel spoiled.  All pens write very nicely.  I like the metallic and neon the best. ... am 37 years young and I wanted these so bad. Finally decided on this set and couldn't be ..."
2633466,B00CRQL8OW,1,"Updated: These now get a single star because of inconsistency. Skipping lines, dual lines (parallel with nothing in the middle), blotchy. The ink also is very much on the slow side for drying, so it ends up smudging. I am a right-handed writer, so it's not like I'm sliding my hand over what I just wrote a second ago. It's too bad, because the color selection is exceptional.

Original review: Surprisingly smooth and consistent gel pens! The colors are quite nuanced, so you have a lot of variety. I'm not using these for drawing, but I could see that use. Smooth and consistent"
2633467,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Overall, I really like these pens. I bought them for my adult coloring books. Most pens write smoothly bit I did have a little trouble with 1 or 2 of the neons. I also think the swirly pens look a little less rainbow swirl and more mud puddle. Lol. You should be sure to make note that there are several similar colors but with different finishes. It isn't actually 48 totally different colors like with Crayola crayons etc. I would buy again. Decent for the price"
2633468,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I have NO complaints about these pens.  I have 3 different pen makers and these were the least expensive, the best colors, and color small spaces beautifully!  I think every maufacturer has problems with some batches of their pens, but I'm VERY pleased and I did not get paid for this. I  like these!"
2633469,B00CRQL8OW,5,ok Five Stars
2633470,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great colors, great product, more ink , great for color books. Would definitely purchase again , and will when these get low. Great value . Well worth the money , Would purchase again"
2633471,B00CRQL8OW,4,"The colors are vibrant and the ink is consistent. The container is made of a very thin plastic, yet there are 4 trays inside which makes storage easy. I use them for adult coloring books on heavy set paper, and these are longer lasting than I expected. The only drawback for me was that I ordered them with a 2 day shopping code, but they took over two weeks to get my order. Smooth, vibrant, long lasting colors"
2633472,B00CRQL8OW,2,"I found only a few if these usable for coloring---the metallic ones are great, the pastel and swirl ones are gloppy, with very poor flow and coverage. The glitter ones are just okay. I will be returning them!!!! ... few if these usable for coloring---the metallic ones are great, the pastel and swirl ones are gloppy"
2633473,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great variety of colors. They work absolutely great, no dry gel pens. Excellent product. Beautiful colors!"
2633474,B00CRQL8OW,5,Good pens..some are a bit scratchy..some are very smooth but the price is very low at times and thats when I buy them. Not bad
2633475,B00CRQL8OW,5,Bought these for a good friend of mine who lives in the US. I'm in the UK. She absolutely lives them and they are so bright and colourful. Great for afukt colouring books and if you're looking for bright colours.
2633476,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I decided to try these gel pens after finding my markers run through the pages of my coloring book.  I am impressed how the gel comes out of the pen and really spreads.  These are great for those little details you can't even see in the coloring books. The glitter pens are very stunning.  The only things I wish is for more standard color pens as I don't want everything shiny or neon all the time.  Also, I don't think I would use the pens for coloring anything more than a quarter size due to streaking. Great pens though Good for coloring books"
2633477,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Being a teacher, I aide everyone else; LolliZ Gel Pens decided to help me back. Have Help"
2633478,B00CRQL8OW,5,Smooth coloring Five Stars
2633479,B00CRQL8OW,4,"This is an amazingly great set of pens for the price, I was very pleasantly surprised. I used all colors last night on a small coloring page just to check them out, I don't like the ""swirl"" pens, they mix together into a nasty looking brown so I don't understand the appeal or possible use for them at all. (maybe for writing, or something where you are not coloring in areas, just doing lines?) I also ended up with two neon orange and two neon yellow instead of one each neon and ""milky"", which I assume is supposed to be pastel. It was a little annoying but not so much that I am going to send them back. They mostly all worked great right out of the box, a few needed an extra scratch on scrap paper to get going but that is no big deal to me, they worked fine after that. My favorite gel pens have always been the metallics, wasn't sure I would like the glitter pens but they took over the metallics as my favorite! They move smoothly across the paper. The pens were very full. If I need more in the future, I will likely buy these again. Really great, good price!"
2633480,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I searched all over Amazon for a large amount of gel pens for the right price. FOUND THEM! I just want these for my adult coloring book collection and these work well! I'm no expert on coloring or gel pens but I like them! I have noticed that they take a minute to dry, unless I'm just coloring way too thorough because I have ink spots on my hand and also smears on the pages. I love that there is a variety of them! I'm a sucker for color and at this price, you cant beat it! When these do run out, I plan on buying them again. Worth it in my eyes if you just want some mellow down time to relax and color in those fine lines that colored pencils cant really reach.

2633481,B00CRQL8OW,2,Not all pens wrote smoothly as expected. Two Stars
2633482,B00CRQL8OW,1,"Terrible. The gel is super cheap, and half the time, the tubes would be full of ink and the ball on the pens wouldn't write, even after wetting the tip and drawing in circles for minutes at a time. Terrible. The gel is super cheap"
2633483,B00CRQL8OW,5,I love them! I will be buying more in the future! :) Five Stars
2633484,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these pens! Great price and delivery time was outstanding!! Five Stars
2633485,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great Five Stars
2633486,B00CRQL8OW,4,Would have gotten five but I got two of the same color oranges and no white. Double color boil and... Theres no white
2633487,B00CRQL8OW,5,Super deal! I got 2 packs of these. I got one for my oldest daughter in college and my youngest that is 10. I think all girls love gel pens. I got to try these out and I am impressed. High quality matches the awesome price that these sell at. The colors are vibrant and they glide smoothly as you write. Writing in cursive or print the product produces great color and is comfortable to use. I have used other gel pens and the ball gets clogged up and smears. This one delivers! Happy Writing!!
2633488,B00CRQL8OW,5,Really good quality pens! Very smooth and little skipping. The pens came almost full of ink which was a nice surprise. No doubles like in other pen packs. Really good quality pens
2633489,B00CRQL8OW,5,I bought these for working with resin. They worked well. Nice variety of colors. Nice colors.
2633490,B00CRQL8OW,5,love my pens  thank you Five Stars
2633491,B00CRQL8OW,4,"would have given 5 stars, but the lid is a drawback.  If I can find a set with retractable tip, that will be the way I go, even if the colors are not as
amazing as lolliz's. look for retractable tip !!!"
2633492,B00CRQL8OW,5,thank u Five Stars
2633493,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Very nice gel pen set with variety of colors including hues in neons, sparkles, and metalics.  Really great set! Five Stars"
2633494,B00CRQL8OW,5,These pens are awesome  and  they  came  earlier then the  delivery time said. The colors are  very  vibrant and they  glide across the  paper. I will  definitely get  more  when  I need  them I love these gel pens
2633496,B00CRQL8OW,4,"This is a great set with a lot of colors, and so far they write great. My biggest problem though is the ink takes it sweet time to dry and I'm constantly smearing things, or ending up with transfer to the opposite page of my notebook. Write great but smudge."
2633497,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love it, many colors to chose from! Must buy"
2633498,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Surprisingly impressive - great set for the price.  My daughter bought these with her Christmas money.  She initially wanted a set like my Sakura pens, but that wasn't in her price range.  We decided to give these a try.  When I tried these out, I actually like they way they write better than the Sakuras.
The colors are vibrant and beautiful.  The ink takes a minute to start flowing but then you are rewarded with consistent color and flow.  These are perfect for coloring.  I liked it so much, I ordered an extra set for myself. Vibrant inks and consistent flow - great value for adult coloring books and kids too."
2633499,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I bought this pack of 48 gel pens at full price to use in my adult coloring book. I like the variety of colors and it even comes with a few mixed colors. However, not all of them will write smoothly and you have to color over the spot a couple of times to completly fill the spot with color. The glitter pens skip spots more than the other colors do. You can use these gel pens for adult coloring books, crafts, scrapbooking or even writing. They can be kept in the box they came in since there is 4 trays that can be easily pulled out. Good variety of colors!"
2633500,B00CRQL8OW,5,Own several sets of Gel Pens - these by far are the smoothest when it comes to coloring large areas.  The tip of the pen is larger than others I have and will be looking for a finer tip with this same brand if they make it.  Will definitely purchase these again. The tip of the pen is larger than others I have and will be looking for a finer tip with this same brand if they make it
2633501,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love these.  Great colors, write smoothly,  no bleeding or smudging.  I use them for adult coloring books and so far they work great great pens."
2633503,B00CRQL8OW,5,Absolutely wonderful for the cost! Five Stars
2633504,B00CRQL8OW,1,I returned because they have toxins. I didn't see the warning in the description anywhere but I opened the package and there it was on front of product. Should be listed in product description. These have toxins....look for Non-toxic instead.
2633505,B00CRQL8OW,1,"Some of the pins started leaking the same day it was given to her, which was Christmas.  DO NOT BUY Some of the pins started leaking the same day it ..."
2633506,B00CRQL8OW,1,They didn't write well at all. not quality CHEAP
2633507,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I bought a set of these for Christmas to go with our adult coloring book.  Six of us sat around the table coloring all night!  The colors are great, and we liked the large selection--especially the glitter colors.  They are running out now, but they have had heavy use.

2633508,B00CRQL8OW,5,I love my gel pens they are amazing I will be purchasing more of this item in the future thanks I love my gel pens they are amazing I will be ...
2633510,B00CRQL8OW,2,"It seems this pens are a hit or miss item. Unfortunately, my set is a HUGE miss. I expected at least a mid range quality for the price, sadly my kids crayola markers look 100% better. There is no flow and skip horribly, just make an ugly blotchy mess.  Nothing like the pictures others have posted in their reviews. There are no actual glitter pens. I sure they have glitter on the outside, but the ink has none. Its been 34 minutes since I did a thin coloring on a tree, its still wet!  I should of looked closer to many of the 5 star reviews, many are not verified purchases. I would never recommend these from this seller, try from LolliZ directly. Horrible quality"
2633511,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great for the price.  Only the swirls skipped so far.  Glitters very nice coverage. Using for adult coloring books.  Would purchase again. Great for the price
2633512,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I purchased these gel pens for coloring in my adult coloring books and for use in home school projects .  Once I got them , I took out one of my highly detailed coloring pages and spent some time playing with the pens.
The pens come in an assortment of glitter, florescent, metallic, neon, swirl, and milky colors.  I used these various formats to create a dynamic page.  The mettalic and glitter pens created fabulous luminous bubbles in the water, while a variety of use of the types of pens allowed me to create deapth to the flora and fauna.
I am going to love this set of pens.
Lillian created a great product. I am going to love this set of pens"
2633513,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love this item! Five Stars
2633514,B00CRQL8OW,2,Several of these don't write smoothly. I wouldn't recommend them. Not so great
2633516,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love the gel pens! They are vibrant and great for my adult coloring books!!! Great pens!
2633517,B00CRQL8OW,2,Lots of nice colors but quite a few duplicates.  Frustrating to color with as the ink stops flowing every 5 minutes and you have to shake the pen to get it started again.  I don't like the swirl pens - the colors mix together on the page and become very muddy.  I am glad I got them on sale and did not pay full price or I would have returned them for a refund. Ink flow not consistent
2633518,B00CRQL8OW,5,Thank you. They are great!! Very happy with this order.
2633519,B00CRQL8OW,5,I researched quite a bit to find the best deal on pens. I know gel pens overall tend to be cheap quality but I was pleasantly surprised with how nice these are. They flow nice and don't skip. There were about 3 neon orange however which is unnecessary and the multi color ones are somewhat useless since they don't change color very often and one of mine was pink and green which turned brown. Overall if you want the most variety for a good price I highly recommend these. I researched quite a bit to find the best deal on pens
2633520,B00CRQL8OW,5,I LOVE these pens! The glitter pens work well and look very glittery on the paper. I don't care for the swirl pens. The other pens are great. I LOVE these pens
2633521,B00CRQL8OW,5,Wife just loves them uses them at writers club. Five Stars
2633522,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I just got my pens yesterday and couldn't wait to try them.  I was skeptical, however because I had dug up my five, very old, Gelly Roll brand pens that I've had forever and they still performed great but I needed more, many more so I ordered these because of all of the great reviews.  I thank all of you reviewers because these pens are great.  I did adult coloring when adult coloring wasn't cool, lol, and I'm talking the early 1980's.  Colored pencils are a favorite still, that said, its so much fun to use Gel pens!  These will be a regular tool in my coloring box!  Happy coloring! Wonderful, as great as the original Gelly Roll pens"
2633523,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great gel pens! great for any kind of coloring books. There are duplicates but not very many which is nice. they come with metallic, Milky, Glittery, swirl, neon and standard. they write very nicely and the colors are vibrant. the metallic is so pretty and the glitter pens are very pretty too. 48 gel pens for a really good price. I recommend to anyone who likes to color or just likes to write in beautiful colors:) take my word for it(; they also sell these in a 2 pack for pretty cheap if you want more than one pack. Who lives in a pineapple under the sea?"
2633524,B00CRQL8OW,5,The pens work great. The ink flows nicely. They are easy to color with. Five Stars
2633525,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these they work amazing for adult coloring books Very happy
2633526,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I have always loved to color, even before the whole adult coloring mania.
So when the mania began I got myself some colored pencils. It seemed to be all the rage.
Well I gave up after one half picture left unpainted.
Then I decided to give gel pens a go and i was hooked. I simply could not stop coloring. Had to remind myself that I had work in the morning.
It glides right over the page, nice and smooth.

Although on some thinner coloring books it tends to sink through, which can be a bit of a problem.
Other than that, I am once more an avid color, looking to get more coloring books. Restored Love for Coloring"
2633527,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I made the mistake of using the glitter ones first making all else pale in comparison.  Truthfully, they are all nice.  One downer is the multi-colored ones.  I do not get it.  There are large blocks of color in these pens for the most part.  In essence, the pen colors in one color for a long time, then changes to another.  It's not as though you could draw a line and have it come out in different colors as you go.  I'm guessing the company decided to do this in order to use of all the small quantities of leftover ink.  I've chosen to assume they are really into recycling.

I have found that a light touch works best rather than pressing down on the tip.  Also, I seem to recall some reviewers saying that some of the pens didn't have sufficient ink.  I check all the pens on arrival.  All were well-filled and very close in the same amount in each one. I Am Not Sharing These"
2633528,B00CRQL8OW,5,I can't believe how bright these pens write... even the light colors are easier to read than other sets I've used. They really don't bleed.
2633529,B00CRQL8OW,5,Very nice pens Love them
2633530,B00CRQL8OW,5,That's a lot of pens! Five Stars
2633531,B00CRQL8OW,5,Gel Pens that actually write.  I purchased these for adult coloring books and they work great because of the fine tip. Color your world
2633532,B00CRQL8OW,5,Colors are bright and the flow of ink is consistent. Five Stars
2633533,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great product.  They do well with adult coloring books and don't bleed through!  Would buy again Great product. They do well with adult coloring books ...
2633534,B00CRQL8OW,2,I got these for my birthday & they are horrible. Just started using them today for my adult coloring book & 3 of the pens have already ran out. Read reviews that were good but they arent. Im very disappointed cause i was recommended them by a employee at Barnes & Noble. I will be returning these. WORSE PENS EVER
2633535,B00CRQL8OW,5,smooth coloring and bright colors.  using in coloring book and very pleased. nice
2633536,B00CRQL8OW,4,I ordered these for my adult coloring books and for the most part they worked great. Some of the neon colors are a little hard to use because the ink doesn't seem to flow as well but the rest work like a dream. They were great for little tiny areas. I would recommend them. Great for adult coloring books.
2633537,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great coverage, all working right out of the box. Five Stars"
2633538,B00CRQL8OW,4,"As described.  Great buy.  Probably would have preferred 48 different colors instead of "" finishes""  but really haven't used them enough (two weeks) to use all their possibilities. Good buy, interesting variety."
2633539,B00CRQL8OW,5,fun to color with. Five Stars
2633540,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love them!  these are really great gel pens!  They come in an assortment of metallic, opaque, even glitter pend.  I was soooo happy last night when I used them for the first time.  If you are jumping on the adult color book fad, these pens are just great for that use!  Or scrapbooking, or just for fun!  Highly recommended Love them! these are really great gel pens"
2633541,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Awesome gelpens , no skipping when you use them. Smooth ink flow. Great price point. Buy these, what are you waiting for?"
2633542,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Wonderful colors. The gel pens write with a smooth, and fluid quality. I gave these as a gift to an adult who loves gel pens. The recipient has used them everyday with great excitement. Great value and quality!"
2633543,B00CRQL8OW,5,This is a great variety for the price. The pens are a good quality. I've been using them consistently with some of my new adult coloring books and I haven't had any issues with them so far. The coverage is good and they are highly pigmented! This is a great variety for the price
2633545,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I got a killer deal on these.  That being said, I really like these.  The colors are good and they write smoothly.  I didn't have any trouble getting the swirls or neons to write.  On a side note, the metallic colors are identical to the Sakura metallics I own at a fraction of the cost.  I got a set of 48 for less than the cost of 10 Sakura's.  I use these for coloring and they don't bleed through.  The tip is too large for super fine details but work well for most of my books. I got two sets and will not hesitate to repurchase when these run out. These are great."
2633546,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great price for the amount of pens received! I gave one box to my mom and I enjoy the other, perfect Great deal, great pens for coloring"
2633547,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love these pens! Nice flow of ink, no skips- many colors I don't already have. Only drawback is, there is no white pen included, and I like to have one for ""mistakes""! All in all, a superb buy! Glides across the page!"
2633548,B00CRQL8OW,2,A few of the gel pens didn't work:( But other than that decent set. Thanks! A few were dried out
2633549,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love these, very bright. I especially love the neon ones :) great buy"
2633550,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great gel pens.  Write smoothly. Five Stars

2633553,B00CRQL8OW,5,Kids are very happy !!! I would call it best review ever ;-) Kids are very happy !!!
2633554,B00CRQL8OW,4,These are the best! Bright beautiful colors great for details. I would recommend them to anyone enjoying adult coloring.  I had been using colored pencils but found between having to sharpen them often and pushing down hard to get bright bold colors my hands were getting tired.  These make things so easy with just a light touch and great colors! These are the best! Bright beautiful colors great for details
2633555,B00CRQL8OW,4,Love these gel pens!  Great array of colors; all are vibrants and beautiful.  They get into tiny spaces well and most of them are very smooth.  I use them to color in my Secret Garden book and never want for a color.  Would have given five stars if not for a few of the pens have less gel.  Definitely need to put them into other storage or carrier.  I will purchase again. Great price for great pens
2633556,B00CRQL8OW,5,great price. Five Stars

2633564,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These markers are very nice.  I bought two (one for a gift).  With so many adult coloring books it is great to have this assortment of pretty colors.  The glitter colors are my favorite. Have fun, be creative"
2633565,B00CRQL8OW,5,These are great for the price!  Would recommend these if you do any type of craft and need a fine tip.  I used these with my new coloring book.  A few of them are with a little glitter in them and the rest are flat colors.  They work wonderful and I would recommend these. Great big set~
2633566,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I ordered these to try using with adult coloring books however they are pretty thick. I forget if that's how gel pens are- haven't used them in years! Definitely brings me back to my childhood. I'll probably end up using these for my planner or note taking. My only complaint is, as others have mentioned, the lack of color variety. However for the price I purchased them I can't complain too much. They would be great for anyone wanting some colored pens for organization or doodle. Good gel pens"
2633567,B00CRQL8OW,5,Fast ship.  Great deal. Great deal.
2633568,B00CRQL8OW,5,Buy one..get one! How can you beatthat? Pens perform beautifully! Pens perform beautifully!

2633573,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love these pens; the colors are bright and vibrant and there's a good variety of glitter, swirl, metallic, etc. The only negative is that they're only about two-thirds to three-quarters full. However, for the price I can't really complain about that...still a great product. I'd buy them again. I love these pens"
2633574,B00CRQL8OW,5,Wonderful colors and good ink flow Buy These
2633575,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I had been searching and searching for the right gel pen set that I wanted to invest in. Im so glad I waited until I found these ones. They are such a bargain!!! The beautiful vibrancy of the colors, and all of the selections!!! Theres metallic, pastel, regular, glitter, neon and swirl! So many choices! I love them all so much! The price is such a great bargain!!! I cannot rave enough about this product! You will NOT be disappointed with these pens. When mine need replaced I will be searching for these exact ones to purchase again. Best gel pens!!!!"
2633576,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I like these.  With hand arthritis, using colored pencils can sometimes be painful; gel pens are much easier on the hands.  I've had little trouble with flow.  Occasionally, one will need to be shaken to get it working, but this may be because I store them tip up.  I paid about $15 for the set of 48,  but I see that this has changed.  Hopefully, they will be a steal again in the near future. Adult Coloring Books"
2633577,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love doing adult coloring books. Have used markers and pencils. Like these  so  much better. Really enjoy using them. Great colors
2633578,B00CRQL8OW,4,"My sister uses these for her adult coloring book. She convinced me to order some and while I was at it to get her another pack. I think this is an amazing price for these. I would have killed to get this value when I was in elementary school fighting kids over their expensive gel pens and begging my parents to buy me a couple. Haha
I have added a photo of the ink colors. I literally just opened the box, organized the pens, and write out the color names. Keep in mind my paper is actually white not gray so the lighting is a tad dim.

The metallics and glitters really catch your eye!! :) Great pens so I hear!"
2633579,B00CRQL8OW,5,Vibrant colors that don't leak through the pages of coloring books. Great for adult coloring books!
2633580,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Nice color!  However, some ran out pretty quickly. Four Stars"
2633581,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love these gel pens. There is one that flows a little too much, and a few that don't flow smooth enough. But for the most part they flow nicely and have some really pretty colors. I especially like the glitter pens. I love these gel pens"
2633582,B00CRQL8OW,5,Must have for adult coloring books.  Smooth and great variety good quality
2633583,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These LolliZ Gel Pens are very nice. I have ordered quite a few of them. Beautiful colors. I use them with all of my adult coloring books, they don't bleed at all and they don't go through the paper. I wish there was a way to refill them and I wish they were fuller with ink. But I still love them.
Thank you
Sherry Helmet, Ca. LolliEs Gel Pens are beautiful vibrant colors."
2633584,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I enjoyed these pens, the colors are fun, and typically are smooth to write with. They do not give a ton of darker colors, but what would be the fun in that. The only con to these pens is that they run out of ink fast. The ink comes out heavy, so it runs out rather quickly compared to other gel pens. I enjoyed these pens"
2633585,B00CRQL8OW,5,OMG I LOVE THESE PENS! They write so smooth and easy and the neon glittery colors are beautiful.  I use them for my adult coloring books.  The silver and gold are so pretty with red and green for Christmas poinsettia pictures.  The silver goes so beautiful with my blue markers for the Star of David. I'm ordering another set when I get paid. You do have to wait a couple of minutes for the ink to dry or it will smudge.  But it drys fast. Smooth and no bleed through.
2633586,B00CRQL8OW,1,"I just noticed that these pens say on the front that they are known in state of California to have chemicals to cause cancer!!  I sent as a gift to someone in Calif!  Boy,  I guess I should have read the photos of the box better. I guess I should have read the photos of the box better."
2633587,B00CRQL8OW,5,These pens are great. I just ordered a second set for my mom. I am new to coloring but bought the Enchanted Forest book and am loving it. Can't wait to get more! These pens are great. I just ordered a second set for my ...

2633590,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great set to use when you have the adult color books. Five Stars
2633591,B00CRQL8OW,4,Nice pens. Four Stars
2633592,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Some of these work better than others, but that's what you get with gel pens. I love using these when coloring, they make the picture Coke out so awesome! Great for coloring!"
2633593,B00CRQL8OW,5,good pen set use it to color my adult books. Five Stars
2633594,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Overall I'm not too happy with these pens.  The glitter and metallic inks are very pretty, but they get used up *very* fast.  Approximately 1 in 3 of the pens skips badly and are hard to get started.  It makes it very frustrating to color with these.  The neon and the pastel colors are almost indistinguishable from each other.  The swirl colors also seem to all be the same and just come out muddy looking. I wouldn't buy these again. Not great"
2633596,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great service, Great product. Five Stars"
2633597,B00CRQL8OW,5,Beautiful colors and they write very well. Use them for my adult coloring books. Rainbow
2633598,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I bought these because my usual brand was out of stock and ended up loving them. They lasted a really long time and look beautiful.  I'll post some pics so you can see some of them in action, the glitter and metallic worked wonderful, regular colors are great too. The neon colors work well but I don't like to use them often, personal preference.  I got a TON of coloring out of this set! Great!"
2633599,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These arrived quickly and are packaged in a clear plastic box. Inside the box are four trays of gel pens: glittery,  pearly,  neon,  regular with a wide range of colors.  They're also a great value compared to others I've bought.

I've bought numerous gel pens in my life and usually am left frustrated because of skipping and dragging.  These write very well.  Some do glob ink when you first start writing which will smear if rubbed before it dries.  When I tested these most have no globbing and therefore do not smear.  They dry almost immediately,  unless there is goopy ink.  I've noticed only a couple of the pens had a dragging and skipping when I used them.  But,  they are colors I don't use anyway so no biggie (they were yellow colors that didn't show up unless you have dark paper. )

All in all these are a great value and I'll have fun using them for lesson planning and grading.  I'm pleased to have found colorful gel pens that actually work! Great value.  No skipping or dragging."
2633600,B00CRQL8OW,2,"The pens are very scratchy, a lot of them leak and about a quarter of them were half empty when they arrived. I bought them as a gift so I can't really return them but they were definitely not all that great. (not too big a surprise given the price I guess.) The colors were pretty though so I gave it two stars. Not worth."
2633601,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these pens! So many colors to chose from! And they work like a gem Wonderful!
2633602,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these pens as much as my daughter! Not the quality of a G2 type pen but way more fun colors! Love
2633603,B00CRQL8OW,5,"for cheap gel pens, these are great. these are great."
2633604,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Amazing set of gel pens. There are 4 kinds of them:
1) Sparkle, with some glitters on them
2) Shiny,
3) Normal (that doesn't look that much as gel, that's why I'm giving 4 stars)
4) and multicolor.

The variety of colors is great and couldn't ask for more! I love the shiny and sparkling ones!"
2633605,B00CRQL8OW,5,its a gift Five Stars
2633606,B00CRQL8OW,5,They color so amazing!! Even the sparkle ones are smooth my tiny complaint I ran out of ink ssssooooo fast! For high use colors I suggest multiples Excellent color
2633608,B00CRQL8OW,4,Love these pens. Many options of colors and would make a great gift for any artist! Great variety. Best price!
2633609,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These are so much fun for coloring, especially in adult coloring book where the images have small spaces. Make coloring even more fun!"

2633615,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I BOUGHT THESE PENS. I'm putting that in bold letters, because the world of gel pens on Amazon is full of hundreds of positive reviews from people who received a free set of pens for their reviews. I took a chance on these, based on the reviews for them seeming to come from real people and not professional reviewers. And that chance paid off. These pens are really great. They all write/color smoothly and the colors are rich and vibrant. The glitter and metallic pens are my favorites in the pack and the ink flows like a dream. Really Great Pen Set"

2633618,B00CRQL8OW,5,Satisfied. Five Stars
2633619,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I bought these pens to use with an adult coloring book. They are much more satisfying to use than colored pencils as they give a much more even color. They are perfect for coloring. My only complaint is the colors, some are basically exactly the same. Also you basically either have metallic/glitter or neon colors, not very many ""regular"" colors. Good pens for coloring"
2633620,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great Pens. Used with adult coloring books. Five Stars
2633621,B00CRQL8OW,5,Gel pens rock. Five Stars

2633625,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love these gel pens! So many options to make great things, and not just for kids!!! Texture is very smooth and using the right paper makes it even possible to mix them just like painting with the brush.... I attached some pictures of a drawing I'm working on, it changes shades of color and sparkles if you look at it from different angles... especially beautiful on the sunlight. Excellent!!!"
2633626,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These pens run out of ink fast, but you get your monies worth. Four Stars"

2633630,B00CRQL8OW,4,Nice variety of colors and types (glittery vs normal vs color-shifting). I'm happy with these and use them for coloring books and 'doodling'. Nice pens
2633631,B00CRQL8OW,5,This is a nice set. The metallic pens are my favorite. A very nice set of gel pens
2633632,B00CRQL8OW,4,They work great but run out of ink fast. Four Stars
2633633,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These gel pens are good for coloring and writing. With my set it did take a few scribbles to get the ink flowing well, but that's a common thing with gels. These gel pens are good for coloring and writing"
2633634,B00CRQL8OW,5,Good collection of colors. Works well for adult coloring books. Five Stars
2633636,B00CRQL8OW,5,I love this set of gel pens.  I however wish there we Moe metallic and glitter pens.  I am no especially fond of the neon pens.  I seldom use neon colors in my art work. So Fantastic For Detail.
2633637,B00CRQL8OW,5,These pens are great for coloring as well as writing. The colors are bright and beautiful. If using for coloring you would need to give a little time to dry. I would buy another box. These pens are great for coloring as well as writing
2633638,B00CRQL8OW,5,These are my favorite gel pens!  There are great colors and work great with coloring books. Nice pens!
2633639,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I am SO happy with these pens.  The writing is smooth and uninterrupted, and the colors look great!  I love the variety.  Incredible value for the price. Smooth writing at an affordable price."
2633640,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Our 6 yr old amazing color-er grand daughter, loves the adult coloring books.
She uses all sorts of pencil, paint colors, markers, but she loves the glitter pens for her fancy parts.
This is her 2nd set, we love these pens and at this price, will keep buying.  It was cheaper to buy
the whole set again, than to replace the few she had used up. For this price just buy them"
2633641,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I've jumped on the bandwagon of adult coloring recently, and was just using colored pencils. I decided to try these and I'm so glad I did! I just received them an hour ago and I was in love the minute I put it to paper. These are great! The gel just glides and it doesn't smear at all! The sparkly ones are my absolute favorite! Great product!"
2633642,B00CRQL8OW,4,"The colors are nice and they work well for adult coloring books.  None of the swirl pens in my package work; one spit out a bit of color and it wasn't at good color. The pens do bleed on paper that is mid-weight, but they're great on heavy paper. Good product except swirl pens"
2633643,B00CRQL8OW,4,The tips are quite fine for the intricate adult coloring book designs.  A few of the colors of ink don't flow as well as others.  Really good color selection.  I got this set so that I'd have a good assorment of color variations. The tips are quite fine for the intricate adult coloring book designs
2633644,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great! Five Stars
2633645,B00CRQL8OW,5,Pens are awesome! Work great seem to do very well in the adult coloring books. Very pleased will deff order again! Pens are awesome! Work great seem to do very well in ...
2633647,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great for coloring in the adult coloring books.  You need to make yourself a color chart though as it is hard to tell what exactly the resulting color is by the look of the pen. Fun
2633649,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great set of pens for the price! Five Stars
2633650,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Very nice gel pen set - very reasonable, especially when you have several grandchildren! Color your world"

2633654,B00CRQL8OW,5,These were recommended by a friend and they didn't disappoint. Five Stars
2633655,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love love these. I am a nut for adult coloring. It started when I was looking for something to help me with a anxiety problem. I would have a panic anxiety episode in the evening. It was terrible. Now I can color and pray. It seems to be better. Lots better than a pill. Love love these
2633656,B00CRQL8OW,5,I really enjoyed using these pens. They worked well in my card making. Five Stars
2633657,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these.  Especially the ones with glitter. Love these.  Good Price.
2633658,B00CRQL8OW,5,Amazing! Just what I was looking for in a gel pen. Using them for coloring. Five Stars
2633660,B00CRQL8OW,5,We are using these gel pens to color fine details. These pens are great quality. I bought one set and once they got here and I realized how great they were I bought another. Would (and did) buy again.
2633661,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These are very pretty pens and they all write well. No skips or hiccups just smooth usage per pen, even the glitter ones. My only concern is that they are not safe for me to feel comfortable letting my child and cousins use this when they color. No where on the package does it say that it is AP certified non toxic. Well, nothing that some extra adult supervision won't fix. Really Like These."
2633662,B00CRQL8OW,5,Such a great set of pens for coloring. I recommended them to my sister and she bought 2 packs and is very pleased with them. Such a great set of pens for coloring
2633664,B00CRQL8OW,5,I ordered these to use in an adult coloring book.  They work perfectly to add an extra pop of color.  They do not bleed through and you only have to apply a small amount of pressure to get the fill that you desire.  My hands have a tendency of cramping up so these are great since I don't have to apply a lot of pressure.  They color and write very smoothly.  Definitely recommend for any coloring or drawing that needs a bright addition of color. My hands have a tendency of cramping up so these are great since I don't have to apply a lot of ...
2633666,B00CRQL8OW,5,My mother loves these pens! They showed up on time in great shape. She loved them so much I'm going to be buying her more of them. Worth the money

2633673,B00CRQL8OW,5,Fun to color with.  Flow well. Five Stars
2633674,B00CRQL8OW,5,I purchased these because I love to color. I purchased this set and another and received a $5 coupon which was nice. I also purchased adult coloring books as well. The colors are rich and they write very nice. My 12 and 10 year old had also mentioned that the pend write really well. They do need to dry a bit before laying your hand over the part that was just colored or it will be sticky and get on your work and hands. Some of the colors are doubled but its the ones i use the most. The stand comes in handy for keeping the pens organized and all together. I am glad i purchased this set and have been extremely happy with it. I do wish that the pens were filled with ink to the top of the cartridge and I notice that a lot with gel pens they run out pretty quickly and the pens are filled with ink like normal pens. Great for coloring
2633675,B00CRQL8OW,5,I just started buying the adult coloring books and have bought other gel pens. I find these gel pens to be much smoother when coloring. I also noticed they do not skip as much either.  I am very satisfied with this purchase. I am very satisfied with this purchase

p.s they flow really nicely except the yellow ones/bright pink ones sometimes need to be scribbled until they work!! AAA!! NICE!!!"

2633685,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Great quality, my only criticism is too many pastels (they dominate in this set).  But the pens themselves work really well and are fine tipped enough for my adult coloring books (and the colors come out really nice). Great quality, my only criticism is too many pastels ..."
2633686,B00CRQL8OW,4,These gel pens come in an assortment of colors and whatnot but the problem I have is the pens come less than half full of ink.  The plastic tray and box don't seat the pens correctly and have a hard time lying flush which makes it hard to put the pens back in the box.  Other than that these pens write silky smooth and are perfect for coloring. Great Gel Ink

2633696,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These pens are just awesome! Great colors, and they write so smooth..even the glitter ones have a smooth flow. I cannot wait to color a picture with these. They will also work good on my card making crafts.  So very excited!!  I do have to say that 2 of the pens didn't work, however, my very handy boyfriend was able to fix the ""manufacturing defect"" in less 10 seconds, and so now all the pens work. So, for the folks that throw away the pens that don't work, find someone who is a Mr or Ms Fix it, and let them take a look and get that ink flowing! These pens are just awesome! Great colors"
2633698,B00CRQL8OW,4,"These pens are very bright! Like day glow colors. They were very smooth and nice to write with overall but they are not very soft or natural looking colors. If you want something that is fun (e.g. sparkly, shiny, bright) these pens are great. I was very happy with them for the price and will use them for drawing and writing fun things. SUper bright, fun pens"
2633699,B00CRQL8OW,4,This has a good variety of colors but the pens are very uneven.  Some such as the metalics and the neon write (or color) beautifully while some such as the ones that change colors as one writes with them are unusable - they barely write.  Seems pretty odd that the pens would write so differently depending on the ink. Uneven Quality
2633700,B00CRQL8OW,5,Tried these out for the first time yesterday and loved them. I really liked the glitter pens. I use it to add some sparkles to my stars on my coloring book. Tried these out for the first time yesterday and loved them. I really liked the glitter pens

I like the glitter ones, they are the best working pens out of the entire 48, but if you write 1/2 a paragraph or draw a small picture the pen is almost out of ink. seriously these pens are really cheapy. Waste Of $$!!!"

2633707,B00CRQL8OW,2,I have bought other gel pens that work much better than these. I use them for my coloring books and they just don't fill in the color. There is a lot of white showing thru. The others I have fill in the design I'm working on. I have bought other gel pens that work much better than these
2633708,B00CRQL8OW,5,Excellent assortment of gel pens.  None have gone through even thin coloring book pages. A great set of gel pens for coloring books.
2633709,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I use this for coloring. Flows with a very wet almost paint like feel. The lay done is smooth and even, especially the metallic which look amazing. I used this in the same pictures as my top quality Copic markers using the Copics for larger areas and these gels for tiny areas and you can't tell from the front that they are different media. Some of the colors look almost identical.  On some of the pens I really had to work to get the ink to start to flow but there don't seem to any duds. The pens are about 2/3 filled with ink. The packaging is really annoying because the pens caps have to be slipped in and out. Great Value"
2633710,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I bought a set of LolliZ gel pens  and the Fiskers gel pen set to compare.  Except for a couple minor pen differences, they were mostly identical.  I did line tests of the metallic and glitter pens and they were pretty much identical.  Using a magnifying lens,  the metallic pens have a finer glitter that makes them shimmer (the silver is by far the best) and the glitter pens have a more corse glitter that makes them sparkle.  The glitter pens are worth the price for the whole set which is pretty inexpensive. Very Nice Gel Pens - Especially the Glitter Pens"
2633711,B00CRQL8OW,5,I love using these pens. They don't bleed through the paper and have a great color quality. Five Stars
2633712,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love the pens, they are super smooth and writes nice. Super Smooth and Amazing Colors!!"

2633717,B00CRQL8OW,5,"So they arrived yesterday and I was so excited when I got home from school. I'm a nerdy person so seeing all the colors and stuff made me instantly happy and I've only used 3 glitter kind and one like, galaxy kind and I'm in love and that's only using 4 of the 48 pens.

2633718,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Aunt Mary's gel pens!  I have bought this set 4 times so far, because I always bring these gel pens and a bunch of Dover Creative Haven coloring books to any event that might be boring for kids (or adults). Family weekends, funeral receptions, birthday parties where some kids are a little too old for the activities - the pens are always an enormous hit so I end up either giving my set to a young person or buying a set for them later. This set is a good value for the money, and has a nice mix of pens in straightforward colors, glitter pens, and color effects. Because they are a ball-point pen it's easy to control where the color goes, which is great for complicated coloring books. And with the clear barrels they are eye-catching, so putting a tray of them on the table with a few coloring books draws people of all ages over to check them out - great for hooking people of all ages into the coloring habit. A staple for family gatherings"
2633719,B00CRQL8OW,5,I am very happy Five Stars
2633721,B00CRQL8OW,1,DO NOT PURCHASE. lOOK AT THE WARNING LABEL ON THE FRONT OF THE PACKAGE.  IT STATES THAT THERE ARE CANCER CAUSING CHEMICALS IN THE PRODUCT FINEPRINT STATES THERE ARE CANCER CAUSING CHEMICALS IN THE PRODUCT

2633724,B00CRQL8OW,5,"awesome markers, great for intricate detail Five Stars"
2633726,B00CRQL8OW,2,"Pros & Cons straight up based on my personal experience.

+ Glitter pens are very nice for fine details on bling.

- Ink comes out of some of the  pens really  fast & thick.

- Caps are loose on the orange colored  pens & a few other colors. My milky orange leaked all over the place.

- Silver/grey is hard to work with  in both metallic & glitter. I  found having a very light hand & using short, quick little  strokes provided me with the best experience.

+ Yellow/gold, green, red, & brown/copper glitter  pens the most true to color pens.

- Metallic colors hard to work with, leaving me frustrated. They seem matte vs shine. I'm  thinking shine when I  see metallic.

+ Ink does not bleed throgh the page.

+ Had difficulty with pens scratching & ball point needed to be cleaned often. Simply used a dry paper towel.

I  read quite a few reviews & thought I had  purchased the best product. I only wish I could  return  them, but I think I  have been trying  to find the best way  of using  them & probably  have  used too much  ink. Disappointed"
2633727,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These are good pens. I have found that just about all the pens I have bought online have been very good. I have tried so many different kinds
Of pens I really have forgotten where these would have ranked on my list. But I can tell you that I do not remember any that I have had trouble with so that is a good sign. I have mixed my pens together and that makes it even more difficult to give you a better picture. One thing I have discovered in just about all of them is the ones that are mixed do not make very good colors. They do not blend well. I hope this helps a little. Oh, and it doesn't come off your clothes very easy if at all. So be careful. Good pens"
2633728,B00CRQL8OW,1,"I thought they were a great idea, i read lots of reviews and thought these were a great deal. Plus they were recommend for coloring books. I will be returning these because they smear. They take too long tho dry. Smearing gel pens"

2633743,B00CRQL8OW,5,"My middle school self is not at all upset with this purchase.  Completely worth it, they write beautifully and the colors are great.  More repeated colors than I anticipated.  Over all though I'd do it again they write beautifully and the colors are great"

2633749,B00CRQL8OW,5,"If I could give these pens a 10-star review, I would. I have an enormous amount of scrapbooking supplies, and I had been looking forward to scrapbooking this fall while my husband is hunting. Unfortunately, the home party scrapbooking supplier that I know doesn't sell the pens anymore, so I ordered these pens hoping that they would work just as well. I'm really happy with them. They're colorful and bright, and will keep me happy all fall. Plus the selection of colors is just wonderful. Great Pens for Scrapbooking Projects"
2633750,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great colors...metalic, pastel, all of them. I like the little box they come in too. IM HAPPY...."
2633751,B00CRQL8OW,5,These pens have worked out very well.  Even my little great granddaughters use them when we are coloring together.  I had ordered another one because we have already used up a couple of them.  They all worked and lasted reasonably long enough.  I recommend these pens to anyone. Even my little great granddaughters use them when we are coloring together

2633761,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I purchased these to use on my adult coloring book and they aren't as smooth on paper as I would like and there are also some colors included that appear slightly different, but on paper, look identical.  The pinks, greens, and oranges especially.  Overall, it's an ok set for the cost. Some colors too similar"
2633762,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great deal for such amazing quality and quantity! I'm really enjoying these. They are beautiful in person. They come with a wide range colors and variety. Overall happy with my purchase AWESOME GEL PENS
2633763,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Most colors are great, some are kind dry.  Still a great addition to my coloring kit. Great colors!"
2633764,B00CRQL8OW,5,The pen doesnt bleed.. I like it! I like it!
2633765,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I'm familiar with gel pens from using them in my scrapbooking but lately I've really wanted to use them for my adult coloring books. But I couldn't find a set I liked for a price I liked. Until I saw this.
I received them today and I'm totally in love. There were a few colors that were a bit stubborn coming out but most of them were pretty free flowing. I had never used the glittery pens before and this sealed the deal. I love how it makes the pages sparkle and come to life. I put a manila folder underneath the pictures just in case I had any bleed through but I didn't notice any. The colors look absolutely gorgeous on the coloring pages. I've attached some pictures so you can see how shiny it makes things.
I'm totally going to order another set of these because I suspect I'm going to go through this first set pretty quick. Hello my new addiction! Awesome set for the price"
2633766,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great price and great quality. The colors are nice and my 5 yr old uses easily- no issues with the tops or with leaking... 2 thumbs up! 2 thumbs up
2633767,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These pens are great!  The ink goes pretty fast, but since they are cheap it's not a big deal.  The ink flows well on most of the pens, but there are a few in the set that seem to be almost dry.  Scribbling on a scratch piece of paper seems to help and gets the ink flowing.  I love all the colors in this set! These pens are great! The ink goes pretty fast"
2633768,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I recently bought an adult coloring book and wanted some pens to color with. I came across an opportunity to try these pens out and was very excited to give them a try.

I loved that it came with 48 pens. Plenty of different colors to unleash my inner creativity. I do have to say though, some of the colors are very similar but it's not a huge deal to me. I love that some pens have glitter in them and some are metallic Some are neon while others are milky. Some are swirly and some are standard. You get a mix of everything.

My only downside is that some pens didn't last very long. One pen didn't even make it through an entire page which was a big disappointment. Since there are other colors that are similar, I was able to finish the page but again, still disappointing.

I received a discount on this item. The discount did not, in any way, shape, or form influence my review. My opinions are my own. Pens run out quickly but love the color selection"

2633773,B00CRQL8OW,5,"SO smooth. SO reasonably priced (less than $12 for 48)! Impressive! And, they don't leak through the paper! I got lucky when I found these on Amazon! Great pens! So many pens! Incredible price!"
2633774,B00CRQL8OW,5,I adore these pens.  I only got to use them a day and they were hijacked by a young adult for her coloring projects.  I had to order a second set! So great I had to order two
2633775,B00CRQL8OW,4,I like the variety and wish that the ink levels were consistent in all pens. Some have less than others. A few of them need help in getting ink flow going occasionally. I like the variety and wish that the ink levels were ...
2633776,B00CRQL8OW,1,"Lucky for me, I forgot I had ordered these, and ended up buying a set of gel pens from a discount store. When these arrived the following day, I debated returning the pens from the discount store. I'm glad I didn't. The ink in these pens are cheap, and the quality is terrible. I wouldn't suggest these for coloring. Writing, maybe as these resemble ball points in my opinion. All in all, I would NEVER recommend these. Quality Sucks"
2633777,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Love most of the pens, good price! But 3-4. Does not work. But would buy again. Four Stars"
2633778,B00CRQL8OW,4,Great pens!  Smooth with nice tones.  I will probably buy more of these. Get them

No thanks!  I returned them unopened. May contain dangerous chemicals"
2633790,B00CRQL8OW,5,They are great for my new coloring book. Five Stars
2633791,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great variety!!!  Will buy again. Five Stars
2633792,B00CRQL8OW,5,I like the pens and all the different colors but out of the box of 48 about 5 of them did not work.  Might as well buy a cheaper brand  for less money if this many pens do not work. three stars
2633793,B00CRQL8OW,5,We love these.  The kids went back to school  this week and for my son in 3rd grade the teacher asked for colored pens.  When we sent these in i got note telling me how thankful she was and that there is even color she could possibly le need or want in this set. These are great and I'm so glad that the teacher and kids will be able to enjoy them. Wonderful anf a full  set of every color
2633795,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Out of the 48 colors, there are 4 doubles. Standard Black, Standard Blue, Milky/Pastel Pink and Milky/Pastel Orange.
I only had trouble with one of the swirl colors working, but a little shaking and rolling got it going decent. Out of the 48 colors, there are 4 doubles ..."
2633797,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I recently began ""adult coloring"" and wanted to expand my options beyond colored pencils.  I really didn't want to make a huge dollar investment and yet wanted something that works well.  Lolliz Gel Pens were the perfect answer for that.  All of the pens I received have worked really well.  For those of you who want to use these for coloring, I don't think I would use them for coloring large areas, but they do work really well on more detailed pictures.  I have had no problem with the ink smearing (I am right handed).  The container the pens arrived in is a rather flimsy plastic.  I think I will need to transfer the pens into something else for more sturdy storage. Lolliz Gel Pens were the perfect answer for that"
2633798,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love these pens, got them for my secret garden and love they way they work!!! Great!!!"
2633799,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Good choice for adult coloring books, though I could've done without the mixed color and glittery ones. THey've lasted well, though, and that's good. Good choice for adult coloring books."
2633800,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Fabulous gel pens! So much nicer than the previous set I bought. The nibs are slightly larger which of course makes the ink flow much more smoothly. The colors are beautiful and vibrant which really ""pow"" off the paper.
I will have to buy another set soon because I have used them so much already. They are a pleasure to use,I'm very happy with them. 10 out of 10"
2633802,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great for coloring! Five Stars
2633803,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great variety. Five Stars
2633804,B00CRQL8OW,5,Excellent colors and variety. Price is right. Pens were all full. Packaging is great. Love these pens Five Stars
2633805,B00CRQL8OW,4,very good Four Stars
2633806,B00CRQL8OW,5,Very smooth flowing. Vibrant colors. No bleed through on adult coloring book pages. Wasn't sure if they were going to be my pick so I only ordered the pack of 48.  If you are going to be using these a lot you can go ahead and purchase the 96 count with confidence.  Can't imagine anyone not liking these. I love them! I love them!
2633807,B00CRQL8OW,5,Purchased for my Sister as I already have these and love them. Also recommended to my Son and he bought them also. ... for my Sister as I already have these and love them. Also recommended to my Son and he ...
2633808,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I am extremely pleased with this product. As a first time gel pen user, I was thrilled with how smooth and evenly the product distributes as well as the variety of vibrant colors! Only downside is how fast they run out if you are doing a big project or have a color that you use a lot. I will definitely buy these again when the majority of them run out. Very pleased with these!"
2633809,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Seriously when I seen these all I could think about was my childhood. I remember writing with 10 different pens so everything would be different colors. I wouldn't hand a homework assessment that wasn't in neon pink gel pen!! The colors are extremely vibrant not dull at all. Even the sparkle ones, I was writing something for my son's summer reading not looking at what pen I grabbed and now the poor kid has sparkly blue im sure his teacher will get a kick out of it. Im so excited to have these pens back in my house, great for project or even just writing! I have received this item during a promotional period and the views I have expressed are my own. Feel like I time traveled right back to middle school!"
2633811,B00CRQL8OW,5,"This is one of the easiest 5 star reviews I've ever done. This gel pen set comes in a convenient package and includes 48 pens that all range in different colors and formulations including  6 standard, 6 neon, 6 swirl, 12 glitter, 10 metallic, 8 milky.. My favorite is the 6 swirl rainbow pens! They have different colored ink swirling around together and it makes for the most unique and beautiful writing. My 8 year old son absolutely loved these pens as well. He immediately wanted to create some artwork when I opened the package. These colors are the most vibrant and amazing gel colors i've ever seen. I've always loved gel pens, but these are far superior to any other brand I've ever tried. This 48 pen set is also a much better deal than I've EVER seen before. They write so smoothly and are perfect for greeting cards, art projects, scrap booking, etc. They also work great on chalkboard paper/stickers! The colors really stand out against the black! I brought this set to my desk at work this week and so many people asked me about them. I've already convinced 2 of my co-workers to take advantage of this amazing deal!  You will not find a deal like this anywhere in stores. WIth school starting, it's the perfect time to take advantage of this deal! I did order these gel pens during a promotion for observation purposes. I only submit my reviews after having ample time to make an honest and ethical evaluation. My final conclusion is that I am beyond satisfied with the quality of this product and the fun experience they make. The BEST gel pens EVER!"
2633813,B00CRQL8OW,4,I wish there were more colors. Even just the primary colors in just a general gel color instead of having so many pastel and neon versions of them. I have gel pens and colored pencils in this picture - the metallics and sparkles are the best in the whole pack. Good but...
2633814,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Talk about every girls dream ! I love this gel pen set. I use a different color for everything I write and I love all of them. I will definitely be using these to grade papers this year since I am a 9th grade teacher. I cannot think of a better way to use these pens. They also make my planner writing look amazing !
I was offered this item at discount or free for testing and review purposes Awesome gel pens !"
2633815,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Absolutely love them! Quite a variety! Milk, jelly, glitter and swirl pens! Brought me back to my middle school years! Great set!"
2633816,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I absolutely love these gel pens. I have been a huge fan of gel pens ever since they were popular when I was in middle school. When I see these I jumped at the chance to get them. A pack of 48 gel pens that came with standard colors, neon colors, swirls, glitters, metallic, and milky colors all in one pack is a dream come true for any gel pen lover! As soon as I got them I was so excited. These pens write perfectly. They glide on paper, do not skip while writing, and I have no problems with them. Only one of my pens was a bit low on ink and it wasn't even that bad if you can see my pictures provided. I love the glittery pens and the swirly colored pens the most. The swirly and milky colored ones are great for writing on darker colored paper and they show up so well. These are great for writing or even coloring. I love using them to write letters or cards. The tips are finer than normal pens which I really like as I feel I write better with them. I am beyond happy with this set of pens and the quality of them. They are very affordable too! *discount received for testing and review* My Favorite Gels Pens!"
2633817,B00CRQL8OW,5,"For a 90's kid these LolliZ Gel Pens 48 Gel Pen Tray Set brought me straight back to my childhood and the memories I have as gel pens are the only pens I ever used when I was younger. I have always loved gel pens because they are pretty and easy to use so when I came across these I knew I had to get them! After all these years I still feel the same way about gel pens as I did back then they are still very pretty and so easy to use. I love these gel pens because they have so many different colors and I love that they have standard,milky,glitter,metallic,neon,and swirl options as well! These gel pens are great for drawing,writing,and even coloring. I also really like that these gel pens come in a box with trays so that you can easily store these pens without losing them or them getting damaged! I would definitely recommend these LolliZ Gel Pens 48 Gel Pent Tray Set!

**I received a discount on this product for testing and reviewing purposes and this is my honest and unbiased opinion** LolliZ Gel Pens 48 Gel Pen Tray Set Is Great For Drawing,Coloring,And Writing!"
2633818,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These gel pens are a great value. They were quite reasonable and they work quite well. I have the Sakura Gelly Rolls also and while those are a lot better they're also pricy. If you're on a budget and looking for a good set of gel pens, I would give these a shot. Pleasantly surprised for the price"
2633819,B00CRQL8OW,5,Received this 48-pack of gel pens this week and put them to the test immediately. The pens all worked right out of the box.  They write really smooth and have a nice color.  I particularly liked the metallic/glitter pens as they provided a really nice color and even smoother stroke than the other colors.  The swirl pens are interesting as they change color as you write.  This is a great addition to my kid's/wife's art supplies.  Highly recommend this product. Smooth Pens
2633821,B00CRQL8OW,4,"First thing I did was sort all the colors and put the similar colors together, making your choices easier.  Then I placed a rubber band around each section.  The ink flows nicely.  I only gave 4 stars because I have found a few dry pens in the box and there is no true red.  There are some duplicate colors, light green, orchid, orange and pink, but it is a very nice set. A variety of colors"
2633822,B00CRQL8OW,5,These write beautifully smooth! Love them Smooth and brilliant
2633823,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These pens take me back! Way back to when gel pens first became all the rage! They are still so fabulous and I love sharing their awesomeness with my little one. We use these pens to draw, craft, make invitations, create. We love them! They are super high quality. Every pen in the set worked flawlessly. They look great. There are different kinds in the set. Included are 6 standard, 12 glitter, 6 neon, 6 swirl, 10 metallic and 8 milky. Wonderful set! *sample provided to review Fabulous!"
2633824,B00CRQL8OW,4,4 star's only cause it takes a lot of ink and will have to purchase more quickly..but they are great gel pens other than that...smooth and good flow but they are great gel pens other than that
2633825,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These make me remember why gel pens used to be the ""in thing"" when I was in junior high school. I'm not sure why they stopped being popular, but they should definitely come back into style!

This set has SO many pens and colors, there is something for everyone. Or if you're like me, all of them will get used. As listed on the box, these include standard, neon, swirl, glitter, metallic and milky. Almost all of the colors are different in each set, though in the ""standard colors"" there are two black and two blue, and in the ""milky set"" there are two of the pink. I also wasn't exactly sure what ""milky"" colors were, so in case you are wondering also here's the best way I can think of to describe them. If you compare the neon pens to a glossy photo, the milky pens are like the matte version of that photo. They are somewhere between neon and pastel.

I had forgotten how smoothly good gel pens could write, but these quickly reminded me! Now all I need is some coloring pages and some black folders to decorate, and it'll be just like the good ol' days! Note: I purchased these at a promotional discount to test and review. I had forgotten how much I loved writing with gel pens back in the day"
2633826,B00CRQL8OW,5,What isn't there to love about gel pens and having 48 of them. They write so good and there is a color for anything and everything you would need! My kids also love them because there is such a variety. I purchased this product at a free or discounted rate for a honest and unbiased review. so many colors to choose from
2633827,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Im having so much fun with these LolliZ gel pens.  I was really excited when I got an offer to purchase these at a reduced price in exchange for an unbiased evaluation and review.  Ive been wanting to get back into coloring, for relaxation purposes, so I bought these to get myself started again.

My husband and I used to love coloring giant Doodle Art posters and doing puzzles.  For years, we always had one or the other, in progress, on a table with chairs around it and would work on it as we felt like it and also have our friends join us.  Lately, Ive been wanting to get back into coloring simple projects.

Im no artist, thats for sure, and I left childhood behind decades ago, but these pens have brought out the kid in me again.  Im not even that great at coloring or being creative with the colors, but Im able to sit at the table and escape the world for a bit by getting lost in the pleasure of coloring again, now that I have this 48 colors gel pen set.

I don't have a professionals point of view, but I can say with certainty that these pens are perfect for me.  I like the way the ink flows, I love all the colors, all the pens arrived filled to the level they should be, and I even like how they are split among 4 trays of 12 pens each.  I am having an absolute blast with these! Great Gel Pens - I'm Having So Much Fun Now That I'm Coloring Again"
2633828,B00CRQL8OW,5,"This is quite an assortment of pens.

One Word FUN.  They are very smooth when writing, and the colors are vibrant on white and colored sheets.

The neons are true neons and do not look dull at all.

Your little girls will enjoy using the glitter pens, actual glitter is in the ink and makes for creative designs and drawings.

This pack of 48 pens will definitely last a while, and who doesn't like value for money?

There are enough pens available for hosting sleep overs and to give in goody bags at birthday parties.

These are a  hit with the kids, so many colors, so much you can do with them .

Definitely recommend, Very Vibrant Fun Colors"
2633829,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great value love the way the gel pen writes very smooth Gel away
2633830,B00CRQL8OW,5,"My 9 y/o granddaughter loves to draw, and she's good enough that I want to encourage it, so when I was offered the opportunity to purchase these gel pens at a promotional discount in order to evaluate and review them I gladly accepted.  I'm really glad I did because the pens work well and the colors selection is wonderful for the price point. These colors are vivid are the selection is so extensive that she'll be able to use these pens for a variety of different projects here at home and in school!

The set include a total of 48 pens that come in 4 trays that hold 12 each. Each set includes an assortment of colors that include 6 standard, 6 neon, 6 swirl (mixed colors), 12 glitter, 10 metallic, and 8 milky (these are actually pastels), and the tips is about the same as a ballpoint pen so it's easy to draw (or write) smoothly.  The set we received had one non-working pen, but the rest all worked well with the gel ink flowed smoothly without skipping. There were two blacks in our set, but otherwise we didn't notice any other repeated colors although some seemed similar; for example, you may notice a blue metallic or glitter that looks almost identical to a blue neon, but not two similar in the same medium that we could see. So overall the color selection was quite extensive!

These gel pens are fun and useful for drawing, making greeting cards, party invitations, or just about any creative project you can imagine.  The colors went on the paper nicely without bleeding around the line edges or through the paper, and we're delighted with them.  It's really handy to have the trays to return the pens to when finished using them as well.  I'm including a photo of the drawing my granddaughter made so you could see some of the colors in use.  Love these pens and would definitely recommend them! These gel pans have vibrant colors and great selection of them too!"
2633831,B00CRQL8OW,5,"My granddaughter  Loved these gel pens. She has tried a lot, but these gave complete coverage all the time. I loved the price, Win, Win Favorite get pens"
2633832,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Bright, long lasting colors!  Very nice variety as well. Perfect for coloring!"
2633833,B00CRQL8OW,5,great value Five Stars
2633834,B00CRQL8OW,5,A+++ thank  you great service Five Stars
2633835,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Nice bright colors and sharp points.  I wish there were more pale pastels, but oh well.  I'm doing this for fun not to give as presents!  Very happy with the purchase. Pretty colors"
2633836,B00CRQL8OW,5,My husband just got me my 5th box of these pens!  Absolutely worth the money and I will keep buying them.  The glitter pens are amazing along with the metallic and regular and neon. A few of the milky are good. The swirls are hard to get to roll easy. The glitter pens are amazing along with the metallic and regular and neon
2633837,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I haven't done any actual journaling with them yet, I am reacting with four stars based on my initial testing of each one (see pic). Basically what I've noticed is that some of the pens immediately flow really well and continuously, others needed a scribble on a scratchpaper before it would write and had a gritty or uneven feel just within a single word. Keep in mind that they may loosen up over time. I have literally written no more than a scribble and a single word with each one. However, what's clear to me is their ink flow is not by any means consistent. Some are just better than the others. However!! They all do work and the colors are beautiful, vibrant and solid (except the swirls, which are solidly swirl). Time will tell!! If they turn out to deserve five stars I will come back to fix them, and if I end up hating and need to replace I will fix that too. Reaction upon arrival: Yay!!"
2633838,B00CRQL8OW,5,Bought with the Enchanted Forest coloring book( BIG hit with the kids ages 8 to 20! Brilliant fun!
2633839,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great pens! Nothing bad to say. I purchased them to color the more detailed pictures in my Secret Garden coloring book. They don't bleed through and flow perfectly. Exactly what I was looking for. Grown up coloring <3

2633846,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These pens are AMAZING!!!
I wasn't sure about buying an off brand, so I purchased these as well as Staedtler pens....and my goodness....these are MUCH, MUCH better than the Staedtler pens! They are super, super smooth and glide the ink on the paper wonderfully. They cover completely without having to go over the area with rich beautiful colors. The glitter pens are SUPERB....I can easily see the tiny glitter at all angles and in any light. I wish they made more colors and shades. These pens are fantastic for coloring art work or coloring books, designing, calligraphy, signing cards, writing notes, etc....whatever you can think of. Just BUY THESE and you won't regret it!!! :) Better Than Name Brand Gel Pens...AMAZING!!"
2633848,B00CRQL8OW,5,Work great!  A great deal on a lot of pens! Work great! A great deal on a lot of pens
2633849,B00CRQL8OW,2,The colors looked good the first time out. All the good colors arrived very low in ink. I've never had pens run out so fast. I couldn't even finish 1 page 8.5x11 before the colors were gone. Now I'm left with a half page of coloring left to do and no pens. Pens ran out of ink before I could finish a simple page.
2633850,B00CRQL8OW,5,The only problem I had were the tie died colors did not work as well as I hoped. Gel Pens
2633851,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love these gel pens.  Use them on my adult coloring book and the show great color.  I have used other gel pen and can say these are one of the best.  There are a variety of colors available and last longer then some gel pens I have used in the past. Love these gel pens
2633852,B00CRQL8OW,5,very good Five Stars
2633853,B00CRQL8OW,5,Fantastic selection of colors! Great colors
2633854,B00CRQL8OW,4,"While not as smooth and as high quality as Sakura's gel pens, they are OK for playing around with my own drawings.  I like the variety of colors. So, for the price, they are fun to work with, but don't expect the same quality as higher priced gel pens. Nice selection of colors"
2633855,B00CRQL8OW,4,THEY ARE GREAT. Four Stars
2633856,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great quality pens!  Some are even sparkled, rainbow & metalic  My daughter just loves these! Five Stars"

2633858,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I love them, but the ink runs out quickly. I guess that's expected though. Great Product"
2633859,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great set for a nice price.  It had a wide range of colors and works great on my Adult Coloring books.  Everything is vibrant and colorful. Great Colors.
2633861,B00CRQL8OW,5,nice set. Plenty of great colors. Five Stars
2633862,B00CRQL8OW,5,"My son loves these pens for coloring, drawing, doing homework and arts and crafts projects. A great deal for such a large set of gel pens. We did not have any problems with dried out pens like some others reported. All the pens work great. A great deal for such good quality gel pens!"
2633863,B00CRQL8OW,5,These are perfect for drawing or coloring. Great colors including some that sparkle. No bleed thru. Love these pens!
2633864,B00CRQL8OW,5,Love Gel Pens! Five Stars
2633865,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great pens, I will buy again when the ink runs out. Five Stars"
2633866,B00CRQL8OW,1,"I would not buy these again. There is a warning label on the packaging: ""WARNING: This product may contain chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm."" If I had known that, I would not have bought them. These were for me and my 6 year old girl. Some of the pens had barely any ink in them, and the colors were completely off from the color it was supposed to be. Others you had to shake to get started. Very disappointed and cannot get my money back. They have been thrown away after only 30 minute use after reading the warning label. Just ordered Fiskars gel pens and hoping those are fine and NOT CARCINOGENIC!! Would give it ZERO stars but had to put a star. CARCINOGENIC CHEMICAL PENS!!"
2633867,B00CRQL8OW,4,I like these pens and they work great and the colors are great I bought them for my daughter in middle school and she loves them the reason why I only have them 4 stars is because sometimes they won't work and you have to keep shaking them until they work but besides that they are great Great
2633868,B00CRQL8OW,4,I like the pens. Four Stars
2633869,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I love all of the colors, but a few of the pens don't work, or exploded. Four Stars"
2633870,B00CRQL8OW,4,Exactly as described. Love gel pens!
2633871,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I purchased them to use in a mandala coloring book, and I am very happy happy for the price. A few pens doesn't work good (feel dry and ""scratch""), but most are just fine. and I am very happy happy for the price"
2633872,B00CRQL8OW,5,love all my itens I have bought whether pens or books Five Stars
2633873,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Wow shipping was exceptionally fast, and the pens work great! and the pens work great!"
2633874,B00CRQL8OW,5,These are grea pens flo great don't skip Five Stars
2633875,B00CRQL8OW,5,Good but Fiskar flow better ok quality
2633876,B00CRQL8OW,5,quite a selection of nice colors and they write well. Five Stars
2633877,B00CRQL8OW,2,Several pens were dried up. Not . so good
2633878,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I bought these to use in my Enchanted Forest coloring book by Johanna Basford. They work great! The pens write smoothly, and the colors are vibrant. The glitter pens are my favorite! I also liked the package they came in, and I'll continue to use it for storage. The pens come in 4 trays inside the bigger clear box, and I used the trays to arrange the pens by color. Now I can just pull out the trays and my pens will be all ready to go exactly how I want them. Beautiful pens in good packaging"
2633879,B00CRQL8OW,1,"These pens are skippy and don't glide very well at all.  The ink tends to fade quickly as you are writing and coloring so there's really not much ink to them.  There were a few pens that didn't write at all out of the set so those got pitched.  Out of the 48 pens only about 40 work well enough to use, the other 8 either don't work at all or work with a skippy action that makes it a pain to use.

It says you get 48 colors but either some of these are duplicates or they shading is so close as to be indistinguishable.

Get a better set of pens.  I'm still looking.

Update:  Two days later and I've had to toss 9 pens because of not working at all.  Not pleased at all. Try again, there are better pens out there."
2633880,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Great pens. So smooth. Admittedly, I purchased these for my 8yo daughter, but Ive been stealing them pen by pen for my own usage. I will definitely be purchasing another set. Great for coloring, crafts, or just general writing. Great Colors. Smooth writing."
2633881,B00CRQL8OW,5,"These pens are just as described and work great. The ink doesn't skip and so far, after about 2 months, they haven't dried out. I've used them on a few pages  in the Enchanted Forest coloring book and the colors really pop and look beautiful. My only complaint (and I'm not docking a star because I knew exactly what colors I would be getting) is I wish they had more ""normal"" colors rather than so many sparkly, metallic, or pastel colors. Sometimes you just want standard colors with no added sheen to them and there are only about 5 of these. Otherwise, great product! These pens are just as described and work great. The ink doesn't skip and so far"
2633882,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I was torn between the lower price of these pens and the reputation of Fiskars. Needless to say, I decided to go with these and I am so glad I did. Not only were they affordable, they work great. I have had no problems with them skipping or not going on smooth. The pigments are great and they are even fine enough to color in fairly small details. I bought them to use with adult coloring books and they work great with smaller images and details. The only thing I wish was different is that it included more regular colors, there are a lot of metallic and glitter for my liking, but they still look pretty and work great. Great Product!"
2633883,B00CRQL8OW,5,"The ink flows freely without skips, and the colors are true to the color of the cap. They work great coloring posters that are made for coloring, as well as ""adult"" coloring books that you can buy on Amazon. The ink doesn't skip like so, so many other gel pens, even the popular ones."
2633884,B00CRQL8OW,4,"I love these gel pens! They write smoothly without any skipping. They take just a second to get started, though. But you can expect that from any normal pen or gel pen. They also write great on skin, but you have to scrub a little to wash it off. I would not recommend dark colors on skin. There is a great variety of colors, but I got duplicates of a few. The pastel pens do not write on skin very well. They also hardly show up on white paper. Overall, the set is great and it is a very good price for what you get. I love these gel pens"
2633885,B00CRQL8OW,5,nice Five Stars
2633886,B00CRQL8OW,5,These have lasted me a long time. Half over half left. Great buy Great
2633887,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I hope these come back in stock soon - at the time of review, they're only available through third party sellers. This is a great set. I believe it is made by the same manufacturer who makes the Fishers set of 48. There are some slight differences in the pen bodies. But the ink colors appear to be exactly the same, and the pens are even packed in the same color order as the Fiskars pens. I'd bet anyone, any day, that they are the same pens.

These aren't the best around, no, but they are much better quality than some that are significantly more expensive. These are (or perhaps were) also available as a set in a round container without trays, but I paid the extra couple of bucks, as the trays are flimsy but good for storage. I haven't had a dead or dried up pen in this set, or my Fiskars set, and I've been using them consistently for a few months now. A good buy for the money. And grab these if they're cheaper than the Fiskars. Like all gel pens, it's easy to burn through them fast. I use them alongside other mediums to make sure they last. The ink is smooth and somewhat opaque to completely opaque, depending on the color. And there are, I believe, just two duplicates. Excellent pens at a great price"
2633888,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love them, I really like the metalic colors :) Five Stars"
2633889,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Kids love these, they are the cool kids in school now.  These work great look great and are still working well after about 6 weeks.  Great price too. Excellent pens your kids will love them"
2633890,B00CRQL8OW,5,They were a gift. Five Stars
2633891,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I wanted the colors this set offered. Some pens are not as painterly as others, a couple wouldn't write at all. I will try some alcohol. Don't bother for the trays, they aren't up to much, but they are better than nothing if they are all you have. Nice colors, great price"
2633892,B00CRQL8OW,5,This was a gift and they liked it. Five Stars

2633906,B00CRQL8OW,1,Read the label carefully. It says on the box: this product may contain chemicals known in state of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm!!!!

2633911,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I purchased this set of gel pens for my 12-year old daughter. My daughter considered a couple different brands, but she chose this brand based on several factors including the number of pens/colors, the price, and the reviews.

She's pleased with her choice. I am sure when the ink runs out of these pens (who knows when that will be considering how much she uses them), we will be ordering this set again. Tickled pink....and blue, and green, and yellow, and purple..."
2633912,B00CRQL8OW,5,Awesome pens they write so smoothly.  But there kinda easy to brake Five Stars
2633914,B00CRQL8OW,4,"If I remember correctly this arrived early which was awesome. Thank you! Only down fall I have is that it says six of the 48 pens are standered but actually yes u get six standard pens but I two of the colors are doubled up, the blue n the black, n don't get me wrong thats a plus w those two colors but I was hoping for more of a variety of color. I am havin a hard time finding a standard yellow gel pen. Basicly all I finding is neon n the one milky yellow in this package.  Create sifferent shades of yellow gel pens n ill give five stars If I remember correctly this arrived early which was awesome. Thank you"

There were no issues with any of the pens not working and the colors are really great.  My daughter has used every single pen so far and loves them all.  There are several with glitter, shimmer, neon, swirl and regular colors.  She uses them to color in the book, Flower Designs Coloring Book Volume 1, that I bought to go with the pens.  I've tried several of them and the ink flowed nicely and was very vibrant. I would definitely buy this again and in fact will probably be ordering some more soon as birthday gifts. Bought 6 sets and all 6 girls loved them!"

But they are cheap enough to just order more.

Originally bought for 5 year old to draw.  My wife is a artist, always make me buy crazy expensive crap, complaining about low quality, in normal drawing pens.  She also loves and uses these gel pens.  Her complaint is they run out to fast as well. Great Pens at even better price.  But you are getting less ink then you think."

2633971,B00CRQL8OW,5,2nd time purchasing these pens - the colors are great - I love to use them when coloring the detailed adult coloring books.  Good therapy :) Fun for all ages
2633972,B00CRQL8OW,5,Beautiful vibrant colors. Love them. Sisters loved them as well. Have purchased three sets due to how much I like them. Perfect for gifts and amazing price. I had a tiny issue and they got back to me ASAP and fixed it. Wonderful service. Definitely will be buying from them again. amazing.
2633973,B00CRQL8OW,5,I bought the Lily Pulitzer Day Planner and these colorful gel pens to go with it!  I LOVE these pens!  ALL of them work beautifully (so far) !  I haven't had any issues with the ink not flowing properly.  I'm really happy with these! =0) GREAT Buy!
2633974,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Considering how spotty and unreliable gel pens typically are these work amazing! Occasionally I'll have one that will randomly stop working but it's nothing blowing through the back can't fix. fun, good quality, and great deal."

2633984,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Great gel pens for the price.  Smooth flow, no leakage. Good selection of colors. Good economical set of gel pens"
2633985,B00CRQL8OW,5,Loved them :) ! Only experienced 1 gel pen not working after a day but it's all good. Five Stars
2633987,B00CRQL8OW,2,"These pens are very dry and scratchy. You have to beg them to belch up enough ink to leave a mark on the paper. If you were to draw a foot-long straight line with one of these, there would be gaps from the way the pens write.  Trying to write with one of these will cause you to rip your hair out from frustration. Pretty lousy"
2633988,B00CRQL8OW,5,BEAUTIFUL COLORS Five Stars
2633989,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Love all of the colors but wish there weren't so many ""regular"" colors (black & blue). They work just fine and look great. Love Most of the Colors"
2633991,B00CRQL8OW,5,Great price good value. Five Stars

2633993,B00CRQL8OW,5,The colors are very vibrant and there are many colors to chose from. Five Stars
2633994,B00CRQL8OW,1,These were horrible. I had I had bought another brand that was great. I wanted to try these to see if the colors were different. Several were broken when I got them. But what really made me mad was that quite a few of them just didn't work. No matter what I did to get the ink to flow wouldn't work These were horrible. I had I had bought another brand that ...
2633995,B00CRQL8OW,2,Colors not as vibrant as I expected Two Stars
2633996,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Nice variety and color of pens.  I haven't worked with gel pens before and so didn't know what to expect.  They allow for very exact coloring but give you more of a sketch type of look.  So, depending on the type of look you want on whether these pens would work for you.  I suggest that you try the colors on a separate piece of paper before using then on your project to be sure of color and initial start of the pen.  I do like the 4 trays too.

I would have given these a five star rating, However, two of the pens where only 1/2 full of ink. Large variety of colors"
2633997,B00CRQL8OW,4,"Love the assortment of pens in this pack. Great quantity for price. Some pens (pastel and mixed colors) seem hard to control the flow- when writing, the color seems to go outside where you intend it. Occasionally a pen will not work well.  I store with the point down to keep the ink flowing toward the tip and it seems to help. Nearly all of the pens work as desired nearly all of the time. Love the assortment of pens in this pack"
2633999,B00CRQL8OW,2,"I regret buying these.  They skip, some of them didn't work, some don't show up.  Not a good set.  They actually made me give up on buying gel pens.  On the other hand, most are like this, so they aren't bad for the money but I would not buy again.  My search for good gel pens goes on. Nope"
2634000,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Very nice set of gel pens. Good assortment of colors and I love how the colors are sectioned in pull out trays. Ink flows very nicely and the colors are rich and bright!

*Update 12/3/15 - I love using these pens, especially with my adult coloring books. This set has lasted me so much longer that I originally thought they would . I don't know why the AVP tag is not showing, but I did pay full price for these pens. This was a good purchase and I enjoy using them. These gel pens, along with a heavily detailed coloring book, make an excellent gift!

*4/26/16- I found that there are times that the ink will stop flowing in these pens. What I do now is when I am finished using them I store the package upside down instead of on it's side or right side up, that keeps all the ink where it should be and the pens are always ready to go. I love using these for drawing and coloring,  but they are also the first pens I seem to grab for signing greeting cards and addressing packages too.  I'm still using the same package I bought 2 years ago, some of my favorite colors are long gone, but the ones I have left are still going strong. Great set of gel pens!"
2634002,B00CRQL8OW,5,"Wow, what can I say about these. Nice color pay off, neons are extra neon, pastels really pastels and the glitter ones are really pretty. I got these as a gift for my wife and we tested them when they arrived. They are really good quality and they are a bargain comparing this kind of set to other ones that have even less colors. Really happy with the purchase Best Gel Pen Pack Ever"
2634003,B00CRQL8OW,5,These pens are better than their more expensive counterparts!!  Vivid color and write well.  Will buy again!! Five Stars
2634004,B00CRQL8OW,5,"I bought these LolliZ Gel Pens for my preteen budding artist. Though the price was lower than others, I was pleasantly surprised...All the pens work well except for ONE swirl pen that doesn't glide as smoothly (I have to shake it to get it going, sometimes).

These pens are about the same writing size of a standard ball-point pen...They show up on colored paper as well as white. 10 Metallic, 12 glitter (The writing actually sparkles on paper!) , 6 neon (highlighter colors), 6 swirl (multi-colored), 8 milky (pastels) and 6 standard colors...These are REALLY cool.

I appreciate that these aren't 48 loose pens-They are in a plastic (thin, but definitely reusable) box of four plastic trays in groups of 12. Each tray includes a long plastic piece that the pens clip onto, helping to hold them securely in place.

*Helpful Tip: To extend ink life, store in airtight bag/container and keep in refrigerator. Glad I took a Chance"

4957266,B00CRQL8OW,1,What a waste of money. Most of the pens were lacking in ink and would dry out in the middle of writing on their first use. Too bad I didn't use these before the return date. Don't buy. shame on you
