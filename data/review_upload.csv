review
"This set of 12 shiny neon color liquid ink pens with reversible bullet and chisel tips will write on just about anything!

We have had a blast decorating for a couple of back to school parties and these markers have made it easy. Perfect for writing on white boards, chalk boards, posters, windows, and just about anything else you would like to decorate. My front door and walkway was covered with Welcome Home for me last week.

I like that they will clean up easily and so far we have had them stain anything that didn't wash out.

This is a nice set to have on hand for bright coloring or writing. My crew loves to create banners to hang up and these markers are great for using on them because they dry quickly and the little ones don't end up with marker on them for days!

Promotional or discounted product provided for review. Super Bright and so much fun!"
These are nice chalk markers. they have a nice BOLD colors to them. the easily wipe off of surfices also. the best part I got these for a trial rate thanks Blami Arts. these are great easy to use and last These are nice chalk markers
This assortment of colors wins!  I've purchased different multi-packs of chalk markers before and this assortment wins as my favorite!  Great product to use also on glass.  Very fun for the kids to decorate windows and fun for me to decorate the car for special events. great colors!
Nice set of chalk markers!  Great color selection!  They work well!  Very happy! NICE! :)
"Although, I love the markers, they're GREAT! I love the colors and how vibrant they are. I love the chiseled tip. The one thing that I really don't care for is the cap. It nipped my marker tip. This is the only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars but other than that, I really honestly like them a lot. (see the attached picture)- And that was being careful. I love the markers"
"The colors are vibrant and it was easy and quick to get the ink to flow. The only negative is that the tips are easily damaged. I split one of the chisel tips before I ever used it. Sadly, it's easy to damage the tips when you are recapping the pens even if you are careful as there is a ridge inside the cap. There is a warning on the side of the pens to take care when putting the caps on - heed this warning! Nice pens but tips are delicate"
"We got Blami chalk markers last week and we have tested it. All ten colors are vivid, bright and you can make really eye-catching notes and drawings on many different surfaces. I already used these chalk pens on glass (glasses, mirror and windows), plastic (bags and plastic containers), varnished wood (furniture and floor  my son and I drew small flowers on the floor to surprise my wife and it looked wonderful and she was amazed) and chalkboard contact paper. The chalk paint wipes off easily  for all stated surfaces I used only dry paper towel (my wife was a bit skeptic about the floor but these liquid chalk markers didn't leave any marks).
I recommend these liquid chalk pens to everyone because they are simple to use, chalk ink and colors are great and you get plenty of new ideas while using them. My wife is a teacher and she recommends it especially to other teachers and parents to occupy children with fun and creative activity. Useful and fun chalk markers"
"I bought these chalkmarkers because I wanted to surprise my friends at the party with vibrant, shiny, colorful funny notes on

different objects (plastic, metal, glass, chalkboard). These  markers helped me astonish my friends and made my party

special and unique.  Blami chalkmarkers are simple to use  and  they also wash quite easy. Be sure to test them first on a

small area especially if the surface might be porous. My girlfriend is amazed how efficient and useful they are. Now

she uses them wherever she can. Believe me, it's wonderful to wake up in the morning and find Love you written on the

bathroom mirror.

Dominic colorful funny notes on different objects (plastic"
They work great and the color is vibrant. Would definitely buy again. These work great!
I thought these were great!!  They had clear instructions and worked well.  I would recommend them. Great product
"I would have given these markers a full five stars if they actually erased. Pros: reversible tips, gorgeous matte colors, easy to write with (except the orange doesnt show up over black at all which is the entire point and barely shows up after 3 layers of the ink), plus you get two extra tips which is really nice; however, the only way I could erase these was if I had JUST applied them to the chalkboard within about 60 seconds and wiped them still wet with a wet rag. The magic eraser it comes with as the cure-all to removing this stuff is a joke. Nothing removes the erasable chalk once it is dry. When I used these and they sat on the chalkboard for less than 10 minutes just to the point where they were completely dry, they would not come off completely with the eraser or a wash cloth, dry, wet, soapy, nada. I ended up having to take a Brillo pad to my chalkboard and scrub at it for about 20 minutes to the point where it was tearing up my chalkboard, and theres still a faint discoloration enough you can still read every word it said (photo with personal info thats still legible is digitally marked off). On top of all that, it takes a solid chunk of time to actually prep and prime all these markers, shaking and pressing the tips in like regular paint markers. I get that a higher pigmentation for such amazing color payoff can result in the risk of staining, but taking matte paint pens (not erasable) and calling them chalk (erasable)? Waste of money. My photos are before and after. The colors are brilliant and look amazing, but they're not worth it if they're just going to ruin the chalkboard. Will NOT Erase Completely (Even with Brillo Pad)"
I used this awesome chalk markers to label my spices! They were great. Highly recommend! I used them in kitchen...
Love the color variety & excellent color saturation! Im an avid chalkboarder & approve these pens! Awesome pens!
"Stains chalkboard, if you intend on using it again do not use these Dont buy"
I cant wait to use these in my classroom. A friend told me about them. They arrived in a timely fashion and have awesome color. Great product :)
Was selling my car. All I did was write on the windows and it worked. That do the job
Great service and awesome follow-up with special instructions on how to get the most from my new chalk markers. Great service and helpful info!
"This was my first time using Blami Arts Chalk Markers and I'm very pleased with the result. Over the past several years, I've done lots of chalkboards for friends, weddings and businesses; these markers are some of the best I've used.  Very vivid colors and the adjustable nib is a plus.  Thanks and I will definitely purchase again. Great Chalk Markers!"
"Markers do not work well. The ink is spotty and does not flow, making it difficult to write or draw. I would not buy. Not so great"
Great colors. Work great! Love the markers
"We were looking for some chalk markers for a homemade chalkboard.  These markers are bright and beautiful, exactly as we hoped they would be. Be sure to read the online instructions as the silver and gold are permanent on chalkboards. The instructions also give great tips marker usage on porous vs. non-porous surfaces. Overall, we love these markers. Wonderful Chalk Markers"
Easy to use! Possibilities are endless with these markers! So glad I purchased. Directions on how to use for first time were a very big help! Bright and beautiful
"Drip heavily at first, so, use something else to get them going. I killed them very quickly unfortunately. Four Stars"
These are great! Will be buying them again when I need it! Five Stars
Love these chalk markers. It came with an eraser and the colors are vibrant. I am using them on a hanging chalkboard in my home to change out seasonally and love it! I would recommend these markers to others for sure! Love these chalk markers
"I used these for led signage boards at a bar I work at. They show up really well and the colors pop. Have gotten so many compliments on them. They literally almost write on anything: glass, mirrors, chalkboard, windows etc. Great product!!!! Great use for signage and advertising."
Love these pens and they are a great price for including the labels as well! Great price for labels to be included!
Excelente calidad!!! Los colores muy variados y muy bonitos Recomendado!!
"Some of the colors are dry after 2-3 times using within 1 month, have to buy others. Some of the colors are dry easily"
"Havent used all of the colors yet, but some did not dry evenly and looked splotchy compared to markers Ive used in the past.. i had to use multiple coats. Plus the silver and gold markers are said to be possibly permanent, so obviously I won't use them the same way I would the others which is disappointing. Wouldnt buy again, got distracted by THE DEAL"
I'm a first grade teacher and I've been looking for a chalk substitute to use on the old chalkboard in my classroom.  I'm not able to use actual chalk on this board as the dust will be harmful to the promethean board I have in my room. These markers are a perfect substitute. The colors are so bright and I love the dual tip. These will be perfect for my use and I'm even thinking about making a word work station with them for the kids. I'm not sure about how long they will last (especially with the amount of use they will have) but they are working with no complaint at this point in time. Will definitely be buying again. Excellent chalk substitute for my classroom.
"Very disappointed!  I purchased these to write on a chalkboard and after I made a mistake and tried to erase, it left an awful shadow on my board.  I basically ruined an expensive chalkboard. Very Disappointed!  Does not erase as described."
"Absolutely LOVE these markers! They write super clear and smooth! And if you make a mistake, the handy little eraser sponge that is included in the box wipes everything off perfectly. You'll have to make sure the sponge is rinsed and damp each wipe until all marker is all off, but just dry with a towel afterwards and no mess! The paint will stain your skin so wear gloves if you have to. My project came out way better than I expected and I had fun with it. I would definitely purchase again! 5 stars! Love these!"
Im using these in my classroom. Great colors! Great Product!
Love the color variations and the free tags are a plus! Beautiful colors
I love these chalk markers! They are awesome! Great chalk markers
These are amazing and I love using them in my Windies to decorate for the holidays. Comes right off super easy Great product
"Just got these for our restaurant chalk board specials - they are fun and easy to use.  One note - you have to 'prime' them by shaking and then depressing the tips on them to get the ink to come out....but, love these! Fantastic!"
I bought the chalk board stickers(same brand) and used them to decorate and label mason jars! These worked SO good. Very pleased with my purchase Work great!
They are great! Very pigmented. Bought them for work. So they will be put to go use. Fantastic colors
"I wish the to was finer. Do not write well.

I am using these for the daily chore charts and the kids and i love the colors. Fun and easy
The quality of these markers is amazing. Good quality.
"Awesome product, I use them frequently and the bright vibrant colors are great Great"
"We love these markers, they are used for our daily specials menu!! Great product!!"
These are not good. The glue doesn't work at all. The others took 10-15 hard work to get going and my chalkboard drawings and lists are still choppy and ugly. So disappointed. Disappointing
These are nice chalk markers. they get the job done. Five Stars
They work great. Five Stars
great for projects Five Stars
Exactly what I was looking for at a fantastic price! I will shop again A+++ This are great!
I had Blami chalk markers before and loved them so when mine ran out I bought this one which is a bigger pack with more colors. They work horrible. I followed instructions to get the ink flowing and it keeps pooling and not writing correctly. Blami knocked it out of the park before and I loved the ones I previously bought 2 years ago but this set is junk. No steady ink flow
Their info and tips about the markers are very helpful! They work really well
"The eraser is just like a Mr. Clean magic eraser, so it would scuff a shiny surface like your car's paint. The markers are nice though, although they are harder to remove than I expected. Basically they're good for glass, and disposable stuff. I wouldn't use them on an actual chalk board. The eraser is just like a Mr"
"Best chalk markers I have come across! Vibrant colors, easy to use!"
The item came as promised and on time. The colors are vibrant and easy to use. The instructions were helpful. I will be ordering more for my other business. The colors are vibrant and easy to use
Works wonderful for my project. Five Stars
Cool colors and they work well. Cool colors they work well.
The product worked great! I bought them for a chalk board I was working on for my wedding. Good product
"I purchased these 4 months ago to replace another set by Blusmart. The Blusmart ones lasted one use and then dried out the second time I wanted to use them. The colors of these markers are pretty vibrant and the markers have not dried out yet. So far they've easily washed off, and I've left the color on for a little over a month on a chalk board. The gold and silver give a warning that they may stain permanently. I have not tried either of those colors and do not know if that's true. Still Working After Months"
"Shipping took longer than expected. Other than that, good product good product"
These markers write like a pen making chalk board designs so much easier. Love them! Five Stars
"Bright and inky, just as described. Though I had to really shake the markers hard to get the ink to the tip. Still, the end result is good. The eraser does its job, and i don't have a hard time erasing (i guess because the blackboard i have is really smooth and glossy). the end result is good. The eraser does its job"
Beautiful colors !!! I loved them Five Stars
My three year old niece loves these. Five Stars
Great selection Love these!

Exactly what I was looking for!  No more dirty mess of chalk sticks. No more dirty mess of chalk sticks
I've purchased a few brands of chalk markers for our menu board at work and these by far are the best. They have consistent color and last quite a while. And the price is great for the value you get!  I'll never buy another brand again. Long lasting consistent color. Great price. Perfect Chalk Marker.
My grandchildren love them and they have had so much fun with them. They keep my storm door decorated very nicely. Thank you They are perfect
Great quality! The colors were very vibrant and it wrote on smooth. Great Chalk pens
Currently using for our summer chore chart. Easy to use and easy to wipe off. The little eraser it comes with works perfectly.  Colors are bright and eye catching. Too bad my kids still walk blindly by. Lol Bright colors!
"Nice vibrant colors. A bit drippy if you use too much, but easy enough to clean off. Five Stars"
"Ended up getting these for a buy one, get one free.  LOVE THEM!  Most of the colors are really vibrant and stand out very well.  The yellow and orange were a little watery and took some time to get them looking bright.  But they were a great value and would recommend. LOVE THEM! Most of the colors are really vibrant ..."

Difficult to write with and don't come off surface. One Star
Awesome! And the silver really is semi-permanent Five Stars
"If there was a way to change out tips on these, they would be perfect. They work great and don't smell. I was able to do a large board with plenty to spare. Easy to use!"
"I used these to trace/outline letters I made for giant 5ft tall posters for a retirement party. The marker ""ink"" comes out like paint and they made everything I used it on look super crisp. LOVED the double sided tips.  They were very useful for the cursive writing on the poster and for having guests write a dedication on the posters for our retirees to take home at the end of the party. So far I have this set of markers for 3 events in the last month. The metallic markers( silver & Gold) are true metallics. They look great against dark colors like black and dark blue. You will be very satisfied with your purchase. Good price great product. The marker ""ink"" comes out like paint and they made everything I used it on ..."
"Great product. Nice, crisp writing and solid colors! Five Stars"
Terrible pens. They leak all over you and the chalk board. Do not buy. Terrible pens

This product ruined my chalkboards. It does not come off fully. I do not recommend this product This is a disappointing product
Lots of brilliant colors. Very easy to use and no mess on your hands!! Five Stars
"I love how easy the Brite colors are so pretty and easy to use. Amazing cute lables that come with them, my kids loved. And the eraser works wonders. Only about 2 colors were harder to erase but still came off with eraser. Love these so much. Beautiful colors and easy to use."
"First of all, not all of the markers would write in the solid color it was suppose to. Like the orange was completely clear/ no color. Second of all, none of these markers are erasable or washable what so ever. It completely ruined my chalk boards and stickers I used them all. I would recommend no one to buy these at all! Horrible  Non-Erasable Chalk Markers"
The colors are nicely pigmented and work well with my chalk boards. Four Stars
perfect!! love that you have both chisel & pointed tip to choose from and all you have to do is flip the tip around. better than dry erase!!
"These are the best chalkboard markers we've had yet. Very happy with them. We haven't tried the gold and silver though, as the box says those colors may be permanent. Great chalkboard markers"
"Bright colors, good ink flow, quality nibs. Lids do not snap on well - come off when rolling around in a drawer. If you keep them upright in a pencil holder, theyll be fine. great markers, poor lids"
I love these! Would definitely re-purchase again I think he future.  Just make sure to follow the instructions carefully on what to do before initial usage. Love these! Great Buy!
Received a great price on these. They came with labels and an eraser. They work great! Extremely happy! Great deal great item

Plenty blank labels plus a chalkboard sheet to hang onto my fridge so I can list as need items while they're still on my mind and a chalk marker included. Great For Organization
In love with these! Glad I can flip the tip and use which ever tip I need for any projects I do In love with these
"The pen leaked and was dried out before it was delivered.  I haven't used the labels yet because I do not have anything to write on them with, so I can't say if they're a good product or not. Pen was dried out."
They didn't seem to last as long as I had hoped. Two Stars
So cute and so easy to use!  I love that I can reuse them and that I can pull them off one container and reapply to another. So cute and so easy to use
So far so good. It does seem like it leaves a shadow when wiped off though. THe gold and silver are permanent. The box is pretty clear about that. So far so good. It does seem like it leaves a shadow ...
Worked well. Just wish there were smaller tips that you could interchange for smaller writing. Colors are vibrant Nice!!
Great! Four Stars
We use these once a month for a chalkboard. They are a little hard to get started (the color flowing) but work well once they are started. Since I only use them about once a month I have to restart the color and press the top in every month. They are good quality colors. Good quality
As advertised Four Stars
Just as described! Five Stars

"Love these. The flat tip and chisel tip ends work great for different drawings. Does not wipe off easily. This is a good and bad thing. Good - does not get accidentally smeared. Bad- harder to clean off when changing the picture or list.
I still love them. Very bright and easy to use. Great value for this box set of colors."
Perfect!! I used vinegar and water to wipe them off. I'm so glad I ordered these Five Stars
I love these so much that I bought a second set for the chalkboards in my office Five Stars
"I like these markers and the quality, MAKE SURE YOU READ THE FINE PRINT! The gold and silver markers are semi-permanent and I learned the hard way after using them and couldn't wash it off of a brand new chalk board (user error).  Every other marker is washable, just use caution on what you write on with the gold and silver ones! Great quality and the tip is not too thick and not too thin! I like these markers and the quality"
Work vey well for jar labeling. Good chalk markers
Love them!! Five Stars
Hands down the best Chalk Dry Erase Markers I have EVER purchased. Even the the package arrived with one mark without the cap on there were no spills or accidents. The colors are vivid without running and/or streakiness. I waited too long to purchase thes. I am a Blami Arts fan! Hands down the best Chalk Dry Erase Markers I have EVER purchased
"I like these markers and the array of colors. All of them easily wash off with a Magic Eraser, except for the silver and gold, which tend to leave behind some color and take multiple scrubbings to remove from my signs. I like these markers and the array of colors"

"Stickers are very cute, but the chalk pen does not work!!!! The only reason I bought the product was because its a combo of stickers and pen. Pen doesnt work"
"Fantastic product with many great  uses. Honest warning about the colors, gold and silver, may be permanent on some items. Product information is easily explained with everything you need to know.  Awesome! Fantastic product with many great uses"
So happy with this purchase! The colors show up bright and vibrant. Dries fairly quickly. Wipes off easily with a damp paper towel. Keep in mind these are for use on NON-POROUS products (unless you want it to be permanent). I've tried it on chalkboard as well as glass. Works great. Highly recommend! Bright and Vibrant!
"They work great! So many colors and also comes with an eraser and extra tips. Easy set up, clean and use. Perfect! Very impressed! Best dry erase markers!!"
"If I were you, I'd buy these chalk markers. No others will compete with these I promise! Excellent purchase!"

Only problem I had was that a couple of the markers were dry when I got them so I contacted the seller. They rectified the problem immediately. It made me like the product even more, knowing they stand behind their product. I will definitely buy this product again when I need more chalk markers. Love the markers!"

These work great!  I highly recommend them. I wish they made a bigger set with more colors. Great deal!
These markers will not come off my chalk board. I wrote on it and the next day tried to wipe it off with a wet rag and I was scrubbing and it would not come off. I tried windex and cleaning spray products and it still won't come off. Im going to have to throw the chalk board away. Super bummed. They looked cute on the chalk board. I just wish it would come off. Wont come off chalk board :(
Good value. Company resolved issue immediately. Five Stars
"Love these! It took a little bit for me to get the ink down to the tips at first - but they go on super smooth and erase easily with water. I also love that you can flip the tips around, to be pointed or chisel. Also comes with a few spares. I'm using them on a very smooth chalk board - not sure how they'd do on a more porous one... Works Great"
these are great for craft project. I loved the price and the quality is amazing. I will repurchase these. these are great for craft project
Perfect. It's exactly what we wanted. Five Stars
"These have been so fun. I used these to write holiday greetings on my little chalkboard and my larger one that was easy to clean (with a magic eraser) but also didn't wipe away easy once dry.  Im hoping to try other colors next. Also I have used these with paper, plastic, metal and I have plans for a desktop surface i am painting right now. Thanks for the neat product Super fun, easy to use and the different sizes are versatile"
The color variety was the best I found for the cost! Its my first time using chalk markers but they work great and erase just fine. Great variety!
These are amazing. My wall isn't wxactly smooth and I bought a chalkboard calendar and they wrote so smooth. Just a pain to get the ink to the tips to start off and if they're up longer than 2 hours you gotta scrub to get them off it says warm water I used rubbing alcohol and it take it right off AMAZING WOULD BUY AGAIN
"I love this product. These chalk pens work very well, write smoothly and are very vibrant in color, would purchase again! When you have a special message"
These are super cool. I now use them to leave love messages on the bathroom mirror and play with the kids in the shower on the glass panes. And it comes with extra points if one gets messed up. And it is very easy to wipe out. Win/Win Great to leave messages on glass and stainless steel surfaces.
Thank you just what I needed. Five Stars

Easy to use and great color. I love the gold and silver. Great quality and color
Great markers Five Stars
"We enjoy these, but the only problem was the orange one doesn't work well. It is more like a see through orange . . . no matter how many times you shake it. Bummer. I hope there is another brand that works better. Any suggestions? Sort of love these"
great product.  works well.  granddaughter loved helping me Five Stars
"Pros - Fun to work with, looks great!
Cons - DIsappointing in that it stains the chalkboard. No long-term gains"

Not very smooth Two Stars
I love using these to create cute little notes on my chalkboard at work. Makes very cute designs. Try youtube videos if you are just starting to use these
"They don't work. It feels like there's no chalk inside. I've shaken, pressed and held way longer than necessary, and I'm still unable to get enough (or any) chalk out to write something. Very disappointing. I bought these for my nieces to create us chalk art while we went on vacation, and now I missed the return window. Make sue all your pens work right away, so you can return them if defective.

I might have received a defective product, but I'm not paying for another to find out. If the seller opts to replace the defective product, I'll be happy to revise my review. THEY DON'T WORK"
Received these yesterday and two of the four are dried out and don't work. Poor quality
I just keep buying these over and over because my kids love them.  We use it on windows and our glass shower and it keeps my kids entertained for a long time. My kids never get bored.
"Not intended for paint-on chalk board, must be erased quickly or its more permanent. Good colors however, and does the job. Good colors however"
"Fast shipping. Nice product, Great price. Love these  Nice product, Great price"
Very cool markers! Five Stars
The markers worked well even on my cheap little chalkboard!  I was excited about all of the different colors Blami had to offer. Happy customer
