3914097,B016WI7ICQ,1,Don't bother!  We make very few copies and the black ink cartridges have apparently dried up in about two weeks  They first copies did well. Beware!
3914099,B016WI7ICQ,4,Works great. The only drawback I could see was that you had to handle the cartridge with great care when loading because it leaks a little. The savings are great though but make sure to take care when loading. Great but be careful when handeling .
3914100,B016WI7ICQ,5,"This product works perfectly, and for a great price.  Highly recommend. Highly recommend!"

3914105,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I received them quickly. I've just started using them, and they seem to work fine. The yellow wouldn't stay in the printer at first, but after I bent the ""clip"" it was fine. They seem fine"
3914116,B016WI7ICQ,5,Worked great. Worked great
3914117,B016WI7ICQ,5,"This ink works for me in my HP Photosmart 7520 printer.
The pictures I am printing now are as good as the HP ink at less that half the price.
Just follow the directions included with the product.
Yes I will order again.
Thank you It works"
3914118,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Excellent product, perfect delivery, great price ! Duh !!!! Worked Perfectly !!!"
3914119,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Tired of paying for overpriced HP ink thought I would give Jarbo 564XL ink a try.  I have only used the black cartridge so far but it seems to work as well as HP cartridges.  The scare tactics are funny when you load up, saying blah, blah, blah about non HP ink, but the quality speaks for itself.  Very happy as long as the colors work as well as the black. HP 7525 printer. Works in HP 7525"
3914120,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Just installed the JARBO replacement cartridges in my hp printer.  So far so good, worth the difference in price. Great value"
3914121,B016WI7ICQ,5,The cartridges were easy to install and print quality was equally as good as HP cartridges. As good as HP ink cartridges

3914124,B016WI7ICQ,5,nothing to dislike. they replace the hp brand perfectly. they are perfect replacements at a fraction of the cost

3914140,B016WI7ICQ,5,Purchased the JARBO ink cartridge set for my HP Photosmart 6520.  The black ink cartridge  finally gave out after many months of printing.  Price was excellent. Totally satisfied Customer

3914142,B016WI7ICQ,5,My HP printer gave me a warning message but the cartridges seem to be working just fine. Great value
3914143,B016WI7ICQ,5,"If anyone is like me, you're going to do a lot of research to make sure you don't waste your money. This was definitely a steal compared to the usual price of HP cartridges! As a college student this price cut is what I need! Dont let the XL scare you, everything fits perfectly fine as you can see. PHOTOSMART 7520 COMPATIBLE!!"
3914144,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These appear to be very good replacements for HP ink, unfortunately my printer suffered other problems (feeding paper) shortly after installing these so did not get to use them very long but will be looking for these for next printer. Sensible prices, unlike HP's!"

3914158,B016WI7ICQ,4,"Definitely recommend these! The ink looks identical to HP's and I haven't had any issues with error messages from HP. One of the cartridges wouldn't click into place, which is the only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5. Great alternative"

3914180,B016WI7ICQ,5,My new ink for my hp photosmart 7510 now if I plan on printing pic Ill need to use the original ink bc this one can cause bo  bos for example the pic shows a ink blot on the childs face underneath his eye but the flamingo pic came out fine both just a little darker too so not as bright Better that paying 65$ for ink on photosmart printers
3914181,B016WI7ICQ,1,"The photos on Amazon show pictures of Jarbo branded ink and even the Jarbo company link.  And it says, ""JARBO 5 Color Compatible Replacement for HP ...."" etc. as of August 6-10, 2018.

But what we got from Perfect Ink was generic, non-Jarbo inks.  See the photos.  No Jarbo box as pictured and no Jarbo branding on any of the cartridges.  And they were amateurishly sealed in some sort of heat sealed plastic and bound with a rubber band.

A rip off and not what was pictured or described.  See photos of what this ""product"" really is and what we received.

On the last photo you can see a close up of a real Jarbo ink cartridge with the ""A"" pattern of dots on the contacts vs. the generic one. Not Jarbo Ink - generics"
3914182,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I've been using these cartridges for a couple of years now in my HP Photosmart 7525 printer without issue other than the printer telling you they aren't genuine HP ink cartridges when you first install them. After acknowledging, it doesn't tell you again.

I can't comment on the quality for photo printing, but they work great for the documents I routinely print. These cartridges are an excellent value and meet my needs. Excellent Value"
3914183,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Just got this yesterday but so far excellent printing what a great deal for my Hp 7520 ink is so expensive, so this was a good buy ill update if things change. Print qaulity"
3914184,B016WI7ICQ,5,I've purchased these JARBO ink cartridges several times now and for several different printers. They have never failed and have great color and last.

This is a great alternative to the real thing, and the price is so affordable. (please don't change that)  The printer excepts that it is not original, but allows you to use it and it works GREAT!  I highly recommend. they work great and last long"

3914245,B016WI7ICQ,5,"HP was not able to get cartridges for me, and three people in a particular store tried. They said they weren't being made anymore, and my printer was only 1 year old. Now a couple years later, a friend of mine went online and found the cartridges, I ordered yours, and my printer is working just fine. Thank you so much because now I can make the copies that I had to go to the library to make. These cartridges are great."
3914256,B016WI7ICQ,2,Loved the idea and price bu and sadly I couldn't use the cartridges with my hp photosmart printer. The printer won't print since the cartridges aren't hp. Since I opened a set to put into the printer I'm not even going to try to get denied for a refund. Make sure these are compatible through hp website.
3914257,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works well for me -- have had no leaks and no problem with my printer recognizing it (keep getting HP adds though - LOL) A good product

1) no peeling off the label before installation. just remove plastic guard and plug it in
2) printer able to read the ink levels (photosmart 7520)
3) printer recognizes them as off brand but only tells you once instead of every time you print.

unless there is a follow up, they lasted a reasonable amount of time as well. Superior off brand cartridge"

3914275,B016WI7ICQ,4,So far so good. Installed yesterday. For some reason there was a little bit of ink leakage I got on a couple of fingers when installing. Printed a test page just fine. Now we will see how they perform over time. One thing for sure is they are cheaper than OEM which was driving us to the poor house! Not OEM but sure a lot less expensive.

When you get the package all the inks are separated in their own package and are easy to take out and pull the tab and place in the printer. These are fare more cheaper than HP ink so definitely buying again. Definitely buying these than HP"

I have always used HP ink, so the first time I ordered the Jarbo cartridges I was a little skeptical. My Wife scrapbooks and prints a lot of pictures, and these cartridges seem to last longer then the HP cartridges and the quality seems to be just as good. Not only that but with the extra black I  never run out of black before the color cartridges need to be replaced. With the HP I would always have to buy extre black before the color cartridges run out, and one black was as much as the entire set of the Jarbo ones. I highly recommend this product, 5 stars. and these cartridges seem to last longer then the HP cartridges and the quality seems to be just as good. Not only that but with the extra black ..."

3914336,B016WI7ICQ,5,Excellent product at an amazing price! Great Product
3914337,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I originally gave these 1 star. The seller tried to contact me many times but I never saw the last few messages. The tried really hard to make sure I was satisfied. After I wrote my original review I gave up trying to use the printer completely but left it where it was with the ink still installed. A week or so after I got a new ipad and decided to try printing from it. And it worked. I've printed a whole lot since then too. And it's still printing beautifully.

So apparently I'm part of the 9% that got ripped off. The first test print was fine, but the black quit working completely after that. I swapped it out hoping it was just that one but now it won't print at all or let me align it either. My heart is broken and so is my printer. So thanks for that. The first test print was fine, but the black quit working completely after that"
3914338,B016WI7ICQ,1,"Didn't work. I tried installing and our printer wouldn't recognize the cartridges.  Tried putting the old ones back in and the printer wouldn't work at all.  Ended up having to buy a new printer. Might just be me, but these didn't work at all."
3914339,B016WI7ICQ,4,"they're pretty good, not as good as HP, but for the money not a bad deal at all. They're a little weak in draft mode but only a little, in regular print mode they seem normal these ink cartridges are a pretty good bargain, so far so good"
3914340,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These are the best! I have always stuck with HP products only for years for fear of damaging my printers with off brand cartridges. But six months worth of HP cartridges were just about as expensive as the printer. So I tried Jarbo and Im so glad I did. The quality of ink is vivid, even better than the HP ink. Installs just like the HPs and prints are perfect. Plus, Im saving a pile of $$$. Get these now!"
3914341,B016WI7ICQ,2,Even though my printer is listed they didn't snap in. I ended up throwing them away and buying the HP ink cartridges Didn't fit

3914357,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Why did I wait??? I love these!  They work perfectly and have terrific color!  And BEST OF ALL - when you get that ""low on ink"" message you can actually SEE how much ink is left (in all but black) because the cartridges are clear!! It makes me wonder how much ink I wasted over the years by changing cartridges when the printer said it was low.  Try these! You won't go back. I love these! They work perfectly and have terrific color"

3914387,B016WI7ICQ,5,Arrived quickly and worked well with my Photoshop printer. Cheaper than the alternatives and cant tell any difference in quality. Affordable and solid
3914388,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I have bought these a few times and I will tell you, they are great. I have not had any problems with these at all. I had read reviews about them leaking and making a mess inside the printer itself, streaking while printing and just not being what they expected. I can tell you, as long as you follow the directions, which are no different than brand name cartridges, that you should not have any problems. I do alot of color and monochrome printing and not one problem. i currently have 5 sets in my desk drawer because they last. Incredible price and GREAT quality."
3914389,B016WI7ICQ,5,great product. seems like endless ink cartridge.  recommend to anyone Five Stars
3914390,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I have purchased these refills in the past and they have worked great.  The HP refills are outrageously expensive, so I have been very happy with these. Refills work great."

3914392,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I can not see that I have given up any quality for savings (refreshing in this day and age) cartridges fit as supposed to and the ink seems to be of high quality and reproduces great copies of original from black and white to rich color photos.
When installing your printer well remind you that you don't have INK made by a high tech industry (what they mean is your not using the ink from the company they contracted to make cartridges) click ok and move on. Yes I would recommend this package to anyone that actually considers quality of saving over brand name when deciding if it matters O.E.M. or aftermarket. Worth paying less"

3914395,B016WI7ICQ,5,They work perfectly. My printer recognizes that they are not HP cartridges  but still permit installation. Ink is of high quality. Great bargain. Highly recommend! Great bargain. Highly recommend
3914406,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These arrived today. I bought them for my HP Photosmart 7520, which has sat unused for four years due to the high cost of HP ink, combined with the fact that the last two sets dried up within two weeks of install! So, I literally had nothing to lose to try the JARBO. Well, I'm impressed so far! They fit perfectly, and I've printed color documents and photos on photo paper and the results are indistinguable from HP branded ink. I'll post updates to this review if things change... but I'm going to bet they won't. Try it, you'll like it!"

3914411,B016WI7ICQ,4,"This product is well worth the price. These cartridges provide very good color and were not messy to deal with. The only reason that I do not rate a 5 is their work life is short. Otherwise, it is the best non HP product I have used. Great product."
3914412,B016WI7ICQ,4,These cartridges work well in my HP Photosmart Premium. I can't yet comment on how long they'll last but for now they produce good text. I haven't tried any photos with them. Work well so far

3914418,B016WI7ICQ,5,"First time I ordered inks,did not want to use the colored inks. I thought that they would finish quickly,so I ordered a second box. To my surprise, I had to print images for my son's birthday party, and I still have colored ink!!! Amazing quality!! I will continue to buy this item!! No doubts!! Amazing quality!"

3914429,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Was skeptical to purchase thinking these would not work, very happy I ended up ordering. You get so much more ink for a fraction of the cost. The printer knows it's not genuine but you can still use it anyways and it works just the same. Great price for tons of ink!"
3914430,B016WI7ICQ,5,Worked well Five Stars
3914431,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I bought these cartridges HOPING that they would work like other reviews said they would... I own an HP All in one 7525... these cartridges just snapped right in and worked GREAT!!  What I like best is that each color is XL in size!  They should last me a good while!
They are a GREAT price!! I bought these cartridges HOPING that they would work like other reviews said they would"
3914433,B016WI7ICQ,5,work just like the HP cartridges but cost less! worth the money!
3914434,B016WI7ICQ,4,"I was impressed by the below.
1. Prime shipping and communication of the package and delivery per expectations
2. Good packaging with individually sealed cartridges that could prevent any accidental leaks
3. Clear and bold markings to show which cartridge will go where
4. Better cover and protection for the cartridge ink disposing spout
5. Clear packaging showing the quantity of ink within the tank unlike my original HP cartridges which I could never in my life time could tell why it says prints 5000 sheets and prints only 500 sheets
6. Better chips that come in contact with the printer metal tips - my experience with Costco has been 80% success with these some times.

I could see improvement in the print quality which, is generally okay for a draft printing quality, kids homework etc.,However, as others pointed out, it did not turn out great for pictures.

I will have to check the life of these cartridges in the sense how many sheets they may print. But so far, I am happy for these cartridges. Decent Product for a Decent Price"
3914456,B016WI7ICQ,5,performs as good as brand name. good performance no leaks
3914457,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I was very anxious about using third party ink, but no more. The world did not end, no nuclear missiles were fired (at least for now), and the printer did not explode. I did receive two full sets of cartridges for the less than the price of a single HP cartridge, and the limited printing I have done so far has been without fault, and I probably have more ink than I will personally use in a year. I am a convert at this point. No problems here!!"
3914458,B016WI7ICQ,4,"Arrived quickly,  work in my HP 7510 printer & so very affordable... 1/4 the price of HP's cartridges.  If I were to truly compare,  I'd say the only caveat is that the colors are not as true as HP, especially the red,  it has an orange-ish undertone, but for the price everything else is perfect.  I will definitely be purchasing these from now on! Excellent for the money!"
3914459,B016WI7ICQ,5,These worked great in my printer!!! Five Stars

3914461,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I have bought JARBO ink several times now and unlike some other ""compatible"" replacement cartridges, I have NEVER had one of the JARBOs fail.  Using these currently on an HP Photosmart 7520. You may get a non-genuine message of some kind from the printer, but they still work, they click into place properly (which was a huge problem with some other brands) and you can't beat the price. A compatible replacement ink that works"
3914462,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I recently gave a poor review because ""the black cartridges would not fit in the printer"". Reading other reviews, note was taken of the difficulty putting in the Black cartridge properly so I decided to give it another try.  I had to push down on the clip firmly to lock in the cartridge but it eventually engaged and now everything seems to be working fine.  I haven't used it much but so far the printing quality and price easily rate five stars. Black cartridge can be difficult to put in"
3914463,B016WI7ICQ,5,"This was my first time purchasing Jarbo replacement ink. I really liked it, the packaging was great, fast shipping and I especially like that it is lasting longer than any other replacement ink Ive purchased! Will only purchase jarbo from now on! Long lasting, quick delivery!"
3914464,B016WI7ICQ,5,Will definitely buy more when the need arises. HP's worst nightmare !!!!!

I just replaced the black cartridge (January 2018) and it works fine after sitting in storage since July 2017.  I did mess up and buy the pack with the photo black cartridges - but my printer does not use them - so I can't speak to the photo black cartridges.  Next time I will order the 4 pack version of this set instead.  To me these have been just as good as OEM for quality and length of use - if not better. Good quality and length of use for me."

3914569,B016WI7ICQ,4,"(not currently doing a lot of printing/copying; still have about 20% level)

To date (1/09/2018) have only used one Black XL replacement cartridge
from package...was initially a cautious pessimist...""how could a 12-pack,
which includes 4 XL's of each color and four Black XL's cost only a bit
more than ONE HP black XL cartridge??""  But it installed without issue
and has successfully, cleanly, printed 5 different sets for 34 pages total!
Hopefully, I will achieve the same yield as the HP cartridges and the other
cartridges will install as seamless & print as successfully (fingers crossed).

I can't fathom how much money I've spent...wasted...over the last 7 years!! has this incredibly cheap ink ALWAYS been available??"

You have to let them dry just a little longer if you are printing something with a lot of color, once dry the colors are exactly the same as the extremely expensive ones I was buying.  I think something popped on the screen of the printer telling you not to use these cartridges because they want to continue to rip you off for big bucks with the other cartridges, but once you move on the cartridges are not different than the other ones.  They even last longer than the expensive ones.  Love them.  They saved me lots of money. The replacement color cartridges worked great in our printer"

3914585,B016WI7ICQ,1,The black cartridge is jammed in the printer and the printer won't work.  I see by other negative reviews that this is a regular occurrence.  There seems to be no way to remove it without ruining the printer.  No savings here.  Just the cost of a new printer.  How do you think I feel now? Danger!  Your printer could be ruined.
3914596,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Did not saw any difference from the original (HP) product. Printed a few pictures and great . And the price difference, WOW, will buy again No difference !"

3914599,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I have gotten replacement ink cartridges for the HP Photosmart 7520 series printer from another vendor and the printer would never recognize them even after spending hours trying to trick the printer to think they were original HP cartridges. Ended up having to spend over a $100 for original HP cartridges to get the printer to work again. Saw a post on Facebook raving about JARBO so I decided to give them a try and ordered a set of ink cartridges which arrived a couple of days later. Put the replacement ink cartridges in and got the message that they were not original HP cartridges but unlike before it recognized the replacement ink cartridges. Print quality is great and everything works with the HP app so you can check the ink levels and replacement date. Great product, fast shipping, and only at a fraction of the cost of original HP cartridges. Great product, fast shipping"
3914600,B016WI7ICQ,5,Amazingly low price. As a Prime member I received the cartridges (2 sets) in 2 days!!! Same quality as the ultra expensive manufacturers cartridges.

The seller sent an email asking if we were happy with the purchase and I said that we weren't and they didn't work. They offered up a few weird suggestions to ""fix"" the problem, which didn't work, and then gave no other alternatives like offering a refund etc. Wouldn't purchase again. You get what you pay for"

3914810,B016WI7ICQ,1,"Over time this ink gums up your printer. Even after multiple cleanings, the print quality suffers terribly. Everything from faded messy lines to smudges It is NOT a good quality ink, buyer beware! As a result I have to purchase a new printer. Gums up printer heads"
3914811,B016WI7ICQ,5,Only if I had discovered this earlier would have avoided spending hundreds of dollars on the HP brand and store refills!! The quality  is way much better and last longer.  Highly recommended! Much better than original HP ink!
3914812,B016WI7ICQ,4,Had too fiddle around with them a little so the printer would recognize them In and out and a little twist close cover not good open and repeat. All are in and working fine. May just be my printer and it is a lot better than paying HP robbery pricing. Not Bad but a little adjusting on my Photosmart.
3914813,B016WI7ICQ,1,"These cartridges stink. They worked for a while but do not anymore. I cleaned printheads, reinstalled, etc. even though there is ink in them. No luck. Now all I can get is blue & green instead of all colors. Buyer beware! If it looks too good to be true, it probably is!  Im going back to HP cartridges; better to spend more money on a product that works than less money on one that doesnt. These cartridges stink!"
3914814,B016WI7ICQ,5,"The cartridges install and work without a hitch. Having dealt with hinky replacement cartridges in the past, these are by far the best I've tried. Just like the originals. these are by far the best I've tried"

Only issue is if could buy the PB cartridge as a separate item not bundled in with the Black printing ink.
But at the price, no biggie.
Yes HP desperately warns on the LCD that these are not originals.
Press ok and the warning disappears!
Great product.
Do not hesitate to buy! Should have found these sooner and saved big $$"

3914863,B016WI7ICQ,5,Discoverd this ink while looking for better prices in standard HP ink. The price for 2 full sets of ink for my photo smart 7520 was about the same price as a single black xl cartridge from HP so I decided to give it a try.  Prime deli every had it to my door an a couple of days and i put a whole set in my printer.  Got a warning from the printer that non-HP ink was detected and the quality wasn't gauranteed. Ignore it. Do a few test prints including a photo on photopaper.  The ink works great Ill never pay HP ink prices again. Discoverd this ink while looking for better prices in standard HP ink

3914889,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Hot Damn!!!  I ordered this product on 10/2/2017 with the free, standing shipping.  The package arrived to my door on 10/7/2017.  I feel that was pretty quick.  The package was also nicely packaged and arrived all in order with no damages or leaks.  Everything that was shown and listed online, was certainly here in the box, and all were XL.  When I put the cartridges in my printer, I got that initial message saying something along the lines the they aren't HP brand so we can't guarantee...blah, blah, blah.  I hit the OK button and started printing away.  I honestly can't tell the difference in prints from this or the much more expensive HP brand.  I'm freaking excited about this.  Although, I'm just using this today, I will follow-up with any long-term concerns that come up later.  I'm going to go ahead and order some cartridges for another printer.  Great job guys!  Happy customer here! :) Hot Damn!!!"

3914915,B016WI7ICQ,4,"Ok. Have to update and explain that after running the printer for several days working off faded prints out of necessity, the ink started working.  As if it needed to run through some printing cycles for the cartridges to work. Frustrating that there was a process but not happy with the results. Surprised and sorry that my first very negative review was posted before I saw a better result. TOOK A FEW DAYS BUT THEN THEY WORKED !!"
3914916,B016WI7ICQ,5,These ink cartridges are a great value for the price. Printing quality is not compromised and they last a long time! These will definitely be my go to purchase! Wonderful Value!
3914917,B016WI7ICQ,5,the first non factory units that did what they said they would do. Five Stars
3914918,B016WI7ICQ,1,Worst product on Amazon! Cartridges jammed up upon initial install and damaged the ink carrier never could get them to eject.  Broke my entire printer!! I worked for Apple inc. for 15 years and believe I know how to load ink.  Customer service non-responsive and I have to buy and entire new printer. Deplorable ! Worst product and customer service!
3914919,B016WI7ICQ,5,This is my second purchase and it certainly it will not be my last! This ink works just as well as the HP ink at a fraction of the cost. I can't believe all the money I have wasted on the name brand ink. This Jarbo ink is wonderful. Jarbo ink fan!
3914920,B016WI7ICQ,1,Wasn't compatible to HP printer. Wasn't satisfied
3914922,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These function well in my HP Photosmart 7520. They last as long, if not longer than the brand name, and are a fraction of the price. Works great at a fraction of the price."
3914923,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Great replacements for the price, highly  recommmend. Five Stars"
3914934,B016WI7ICQ,5,these work great for my Photosmart 5520 printer. I wish I had begun using these along time ago! great
3914935,B016WI7ICQ,5,"The Jarbo print cartridges are the best quality refills I have used.
I recently printed 115 four by six pictures and the printer ink supply monitor showed less than one quarter of the ink used per cartridge.
The picture quality was excellent.
Jarbo....keep up the good work! Best refills you can buy."
3914936,B016WI7ICQ,5,These work great!  Will order again. Nice Color
3914937,B016WI7ICQ,1,"While installing the product, the ink from the black cartridge leaked on my hand, clothes, and the carpet.  The printer would not recognize the cartridges. Very disappointed."

3914942,B016WI7ICQ,5,These work fantastically in my printer! My warranty on my printer has been up for quite some time and therefore I refuse to pay the ridiculous price of Cannon ink. I'm a teacher and go through about 1 black cartridge every 2 weeks! This brand makes it affordable! I've been using them for a couple of years now and will continue to until my printer dies! Great product for my old printer
3914943,B016WI7ICQ,5,Cartridges are working fine...no problems at all....thanks Five Stars

3914957,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Got a printer from a friend and needed new ink and found this one. Usually the hp ink for one set is like $70 but this one was $20 for 2 sets. So i am really happy with the price and the performances. Didnt have any issues with the printer not recognizing them or anything, was a good old plug and play system. Printing first time with this new ink was also great no smudges or leaks but will keep you guys updated if anything occurs of that nature. Do recommend to everyone. Best cheap ink, quality performance!"

3914964,B016WI7ICQ,4,Cartridges worked in my HP deskjet. Did get the message about the cartridge being foreign and not HP brand but accepting the use of the cartridge allowed printing with no issue.

My kids love to print random garbage and I do not have to tell them not to waste the ink!! If you are considering ordering these, go for it! Great alternative to those pricey cartridges!"

When I installed them, the printer did not recognize them and stated that there were no cartridges in the printer.  I tried to print numerous times, the printer would not print.  Then, it suddenly printed.  Once it had printed it recognized the cartridges.  I then had it do an alignment and a cleaning of the print head.  Since then the printer has worked perfectly.

Wouldn't recommend them at all
3915032,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Good replacement ink! Seems like I don't use my printer often enough to fully use the ink cartridges, and I hate to pay a lot for brand name ink that eventually dries up. This stuff works fine, and fits my needs. Run a couple of pages through before you judge. The cartridges I received needed a couple of test pages printed before they properly distributed ink. After that, they have been great! I'll definitely be purchasing these again. Good replacement ink at a great price!"

3915089,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I have used Jarbo before they are about the best aftermarket ink cartridges on the market.  I am using these with an HP Photosmart 7510 printer that I got for free from the 'still good' pile at the town transfer station (also known as the dump).  Anyway this printer takes FIVE catridges.  Regular black, photo black, magenta, cyan and yellow.  All but the regular black were in need of replacing though there was some ink in them.  I changed all four at a time to Jarbo cartriges.  The printer immediately said ""these are used or counterfeit cartridges do you want to continue"" on the printer front panel.  I just pressed the OK button and continued.  The printer does not nag me any more.  I have printed about 10 pages in color.  The color on these is every bit as good as the HP ink in my opinion.  I like the fact that the Jarbo sets always give you an extra black cartridge since if you are like me, you print more black and white printouts even with the color printer.  Anyway that's all I have to say. Very satisfied with Jarbo cartridges for my HP Photosmart 7510 printer."

3915172,B016WI7ICQ,2,Did not have any problems with leaking.  Only problem I had was some of the black ink cartridges did not fit in the black spot.  The ink port was too small. Did not have any problems with leaking. Only problem ...
3915173,B016WI7ICQ,1,These looked and sounded great after all the reviews I read online. It is a shame that the cartridges do not work on my printer. Maybe I received a bad batch of them but I tried two different black ink replacements and they do not print. I followed the directions from other reviews about acknowledging that these were not HP brand and it still didn't work with my HP Photosmart 6520. Very disappointed Did not work...now I can't even print a return label
3915194,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Received my order quickly and ink seems to work just fine! Have only tried 2 so far, but no problems with them!  And can't beat the price! Thanks! Happy customer"
3915195,B016WI7ICQ,5,Fantastic alternative to expensive name brand ink!  Arrived packaged very nicely and has worked beautifully in my printer. Great buy!

3915201,B016WI7ICQ,5,These were the perfect thing we needed and the price was right!  Would order again. Jarbo 5 color replacements
3915202,B016WI7ICQ,5,"My HP7520 printer needed ink.  Decided to try JARBO due to cost savings vs. HP Original.  I replaced the Yellow while still using magenta -cyan-black HP.  Photos printed perfectly.  Next had to replace the magenta.  Photos printed perfectly.  I have not replaced the cyan cartridge yet but don't anticipate any problems.  I highly recommend this product.

I use 564XL ink cartridges. Great Ink @ good price!"
3915203,B016WI7ICQ,5,"*** UPDATE***  My printers black print head was all gunked up after years  of use. The print head cleaning function on the printer was not enough to clean the head. After using rubbing alcohol and a syringe I was able to manually clean the head and get the black ink flowing again. My printer  is now printing very well again with the black and color inks. If you're having the same issue try cleaning your printer!
***
Very happy with the color ink, it has printed beautifully. The black ink however hasn't printed a drop. I've tried two of the cartridges. If you have an HP Deskjet 3522 don't count on the black ink. ***UPDATED*** Color great, black not so much"
3915224,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I ordered this based on reviews from other customers.  While there is always a chance of printer errors with regard to off-brand ink, I did not have any issues with this product.  The packaging was perfect and easy to open.  I was pleased with the ease of changing out to this ink.  The print quality for our school work and at-home business is stellar.  I cannot speak to photo print quality as I have not used it for photographs; that is not a common use of this printer in our home.  I will purchase from here again and highly recommend this product. Easy to use, great quality"

A little about me as a customer: I am a teacher, so I use my printer for school as well as for my personal use, and I use a lot of ink especially at the beginning of the school year.
Sincerely,
Beth Peterson I've been very happy with the ink cartridge replacements"
3915292,B016WI7ICQ,1,Printer would not work with these - error message that they were not HP cartridges.  I buy non-HP ink all the time.  Never got that with other brands.  Printer probably got an update that won't allow it.  Sigh ... Would not work with my printer

3915317,B016WI7ICQ,4,"It has been working great so far.  Problem? It only came with 3 of the black cartridges instead of 4 as promised.  I didn't notice until I went to use it and now the return window is closed.  That part is not the products fault but the missing cartridge is, so... Great deal on ink, but did not come exactly as advertised. I would buy this product again though as I am guessing that this mistake was an accidental fluke and not common practice.

Update: 8/7/17:
Seller read the review and offered a small portion of the purchase price as a refund.  I appreciate the follow up and the token refund was a good faith effort to make it right.  I accepted the gesture.  As I said before, I'm sure it was an accident and I would order from them again.  The fact that they made an effort to make it right shows they value the customer. Great price on ink... didn't get it all. (Updated)"

3915325,B016WI7ICQ,4,Did not work on my HP Photosmart 7525 the printer would tell me I'm out of paper which I wasn't. This led me to believe that the Jarbo ink cartridges were the problem. I replaced all the Jarbo for Genuine HP and I still have the problem. As of right now I cannot say that the Jarbo did or didn't work. However I did receive a quick response from the manufacturer when I did comment on it not working standing behind their product 100%. Still don't know

3915359,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I was a little cautious about ordering this product. It seemed too good to be true. I thought there had to be something inferior of these print cartridges for the price being asked. Locally I have been purchasing the official HP cartridges and have been paying $60 or more for one set. When the cartridges arrived and I put them in my printer I noticed the ink was a little thinner, also there was some seepage of the cartridge in the ink package itself (no ink leaked out of the plastic wrapper). When I installed the cartridges I ran several quality tests, the results were great. I could not tell any difference between these cartridges and the HP. I use my printer for reference images in the paintings I create. I go through a lot of ink. I am very pleased with this purchase and I have been using these cartridges for over a week now and haven't had any problems. I can't tell any significant difference between these cartridges and the HP brand, I will purchase again."

The cartridges have done a great job on every type of printing.  I'm especially pleased with the graphics results.  Clean and clear pictures with no blurring or bleeding.

I took out the ink cartridges and the cartridge holder and cleaned it under hot water, let it dry and and then put it back in the printer. The other thing you can try is to take all the ink cartridges out and put back one at a time, if this does not work first time do it again. My combination of the two seemed to work because the printer recognized the ink cartridge after I did both. Getting printer to recognize ink cartridge"

UPDATE:  Jarbo reached out to me after seeing my review. I told them my problem--that the black cartridges did not fit---They wanted to make it right, to make me happy. They sent me a brand new full package of cartridges, colored ink and black, free of charge. This time they fit.

3915452,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Great price. So far, they work as well as the original name brand.  Your printer will give you an error message when these are installed (as not being genuine), but that can be over ridden.  Be aware that the printer manufacturer may void the printer's warranty if you use anything other than their brand.  For me, it was worth it, considering the high price of the brand name cartridges. Work Great - and very Good Price"

Now you can have a back up and not go broke

I have no idea how long these cartridges last but I'll be sure and update my review at a later time on thats feature. I will buy these again if they last and for the first time making more color copies! ... used this ink in my HP and it is better than the HP inks
3915457,B016WI7ICQ,5,"It is not printing. The cartridges are in the right place but only the greyscale works and most of the time it prints blank pages. When I do print. Test page it comes out with faded color and the printer diagnostics show nothing in the large cartrige. I hate to start reloading ink to try to get it to work. Do you have an idea what is wrong? I will be away till Monday, but any help is really appreciated. Help!"
3915458,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I own an HP 7520 photo smart all in one printer.  The black ink yellow and cyan fit but the magenta seemed to big to fit. More ink and tighter fit works fine.
After a printer head adjusted all inks fit. All inks fit."
3915459,B016WI7ICQ,5,Cartridges work perfectly and at a fraction of the cost of HP! Works Perfect!
3915460,B016WI7ICQ,5,These cartridges worked perfectly immediately.  Many thanks. ORDER THESE CARTRIDGES YOU WILL LIKE THEM

3915472,B016WI7ICQ,5,This was my 2nd purchase of replacement ink from JARBO. I have no complaints at all and will definitely be purchasing again! Great Value!
3915473,B016WI7ICQ,5,"OMG!!!  Y'all, this ink is FANTASTIC!!  What a beautiful high quality product at a delightful price!!!  When I noticed the pack had the black photo cartridge, I thought this deal may be too good to be true.  I am tickled to death about this great find and am telling all my friends about this marvelous, long lasting (better than refilling at costco!) Ink cartridge package. FANTASTIC PRODUCT!"

3915477,B016WI7ICQ,2,"Doesn't fit the second black cartridge. Sadly, these are problematic for the Epson 320. Lot's of printer issues and quality is just ok. As for the XL extra black cartridge - never got to use it. Had to toss it because it didn't work. Won't be buying these anytime soon. Sorry, not worth the headache. Poor quality and Epson 320 working order"
3915478,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works great! Printer recognized that they were not hp brand but worked fine. Five Stars
3915479,B016WI7ICQ,5,I have had this product for 2 months now and could not be more satisfied. Same quality at a better price. The printer complained when I installed the cartridges but has performed just as well. Works just as well as the High Price cartridges.
3915480,B016WI7ICQ,5,Just installed ink cartridges...printed my first piece...worked good.....price is fantastic.....will add another review....after printing for a while..... Good product
3915481,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I was very skeptical when ordering ink that wasn't manufactured by the same brand of our printer, but took the plunge because the price seemed too good to be true. Boy was I surprised! Great product at a phenomenal price! I will be buying this product for the lifetime of the printer. Skeptical due to price, read on"

I bought these cartridges and will now be buying them again.  They work great.  I did get a message on the printer saying that there were ""non HP"" cartridges installed so I hit a button and kept going.  No issues.  Thanks Jarbo for making printing fun and affordable again!  You have to remove the little orange plastic thing to get the cartridges in, which is a little different than the HP ones, but they fit in just fine.  I did not have a big ink mess or anything.  Great product! They work great. I did get a message on the printer ..."
3915495,B016WI7ICQ,1,"I really wanted to like this products - love the price!  I replaced all 4 cartridges on my HP 5520 (564xl cartridges).  It immediately jammed my printer and I couldn't get the cartridges to slide.  Turned off the printer, worked to unjam the cartridge and tried again (2 more times).  On the 3rd time it printed, but was so hazy that the you couldn't really see the faces in the picture.  I printed out the return shipment slip and it is a very light grey.  I won't even be able to use it for returning the cartridges.  I hope I didn't mess up my printer.  I need to buy regular cartridges and see if my printer still works. Jammed my printer!"
3915496,B016WI7ICQ,4,Works great on my HP printer. Four Stars
3915497,B016WI7ICQ,5,I'm a repeat customer. I've used after market cartridges before and usually go back to manufacturer cartridges but I won't be throwing my money away on those overpriced cartridges anymore. These are great. They don't give me errror meaaages and I even date them when I put them in to see how long they last. I'm quite happy with the quality and how long the ink lasts in cartridge. Stop paying for overpriced manufacturer cartridges
3915498,B016WI7ICQ,5,Although the color cartridges fit my printer - my printer WILL NOT utilize them - Disappointed - UPDATE: new cartridges sent at no cost by seller and are working good. Great customer service!

3915501,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works great. No issues at all with my hp printer. Very cheap compared.

3915537,B016WI7ICQ,4,Worked in my printer with no issues so far. Would have given 5 stars but haven't printed much yet or tried out the photo quality. Can't beat the price and quantity that's for sure. So far so good

3915541,B016WI7ICQ,5,Very pleased with the cartridges - well packaged and fast delivery. These were purchased after getting major sticker shock at Cartridge World.

3915545,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These cartridges work as well as the HP ones that they keep warning me that I need to get rather than use some untrusted cartridges.  These Jarbo work just great.  They have large quantities of ink....and when you get a package deal, you always have enough on hand. Great Compatible Replacements"

3915567,B016WI7ICQ,5,So far the replacement cartridges are awesome. And at a fraction of what we have always paid for HP cartridges before. All good so far!
3915568,B016WI7ICQ,5,"With OEM carts being as expensive as they are and with commercial refills leaking and making a complete mess inside my printer, I decided to try the Jarbo printer cartridges.

I was pleased with both the price, which was outstanding and the performance, which is exactly like the OEM cartridges I have purchased in the past. All the colors are bright and Vivid, the black is dark and dense.

One other thought, quality of construction and the seal that comes on the bottom of the cart we're all done to high standards and I'm very impressed with the craftsmanship. Who could ask for anything more?"
3915569,B016WI7ICQ,5,Glad I ordered these ink cartridges.  Good value! Great Buy!
3915570,B016WI7ICQ,5,Work great! Would buy again!

3915600,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I was very reluctant to purchase these because I have dealt with HP ink cartridges for many years as I have always had HP printers ( present printer is a 7520) and had purchased ""refillable"" ones too that never would work because they were not genuine HP  but these Jarbo's  actually work. When I first put them in it did display that they were not HP  and quality may not be good but I have been printing and  it has not displayed that since then so I am happy with  so far. These are pretty good and well worth the $$"

3915672,B016WI7ICQ,5,"All things man made can and will fail. Previously, I was using another brand of ink cartridges that worked fine but the colors were not up to par when I printed a picture. I understood that I wasn't getting HP ink but when considering price vs. quality, I felt that it was a good trade off given that I seldom print pictures. I went back on Amazon to buy more prior to running out of them so that I wouldn't get caught short. While doing so, I saw the JARBO cartridges and decided to try them. Relative to appearance, the cartridges make a good impression. When they arrived, I stashed them away because I was still using the remaining cartridges from the other brand. Recently, I began using the JARBO cartridges. Immediately, I began to have intermittent ink blotting. Also, I have entire segments of printed documents with unreadable text. Of course, I put my printer through the paces of head realignment and cleaning but the problem persists. Can I say definitively that it is the fault of the cartridges? No, but these are 564xl cartridges that have the print head on the cartridge and the aberrant print issues started when I began using the JARBO cartridges. Note that I printed some documents this morning that were fine.

UPDATE:
The company contacted me and apologized for the problems that I am having and expressed their willingness to make things right. I sent pictures of some recently printed documents that contained smudged or missing print. They responded by sending replacement cartridges (to my mother's address because I made a purchase for her following my initial purchase). No matter, I'm pleased that they are attempting to honor their good name. What's interesting is that my cartridge is no longer producing flawed print. I am surmising that it may have been over filled but that's an unqualified guess. Whatever the case, my documents are now printing perfectly. A good takeaway is that the company stands by its product! I'm giving them 5 stars! First usage not going well at the moment. (see update!)"
3915673,B016WI7ICQ,5,"So far so good, I used in a HP 7500 color printer, it said not an authorized ink but works good. So far so good, I used in a HP 7500 color printer"
3915674,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Updated: The customer service group for JARBO is very dedicated to making the customer happy. After seeing my review they have worked diligently to fix my issue with their product. I would recommend trying their ink for your printer. My HP printer wasn't ""happy"" about the non HP ink, but the ink seems to be working fine.  The only complaint I have is that one of the black cartridges wouldn't work correctly, and the cartridge was misshapen or something.  I had to forcibly remove it in order to replace it with the other one.  For this reason, I will probably buy the HP ink next time. but the ink seems to be working fine.

I'm not sure if they will last as long as the HP cartridges, but if they do this is a great bargain. These are the first generic cartridges that I have seen that actually have the manufacturer's name on them, so that's a good sign. So far, so good."
3915737,B016WI7ICQ,4,"Initially the black replacement did not work well, spotty coverage and smeared.  Ran a cleaning once and then the black as well as the colored cartridges worked great...as good as HP replacements. Initial issue but then great performance"
3915738,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These are economical replacements for HP ink. They were shipped quickly and arrived as expected. As far as performance, I've printed a few documents and they work great. Easy Choice to Replace Factory Ink Cartridges"
3915739,B016WI7ICQ,4,"Printer recognizes that it's not an HP ink cartridge but seems to work fine on the general print jobs I've tried. Have not tried photo prints yet.
Can't beet the price. ... not an HP ink cartridge but seems to work fine on the general print jobs I've tried"
3915740,B016WI7ICQ,5,Just as good as HP. Five Stars
3915741,B016WI7ICQ,5,These cartridges worked great in my printer and saved me money.  I'll continue to use these in the future.  I will recommend these to my friends. Worked Great and a great deal!
3915752,B016WI7ICQ,5,Worked with no problems.  Color looks great.  Shipped and arrived early.  Printer recognized the off brand and accepted it no problems Great deal
3915753,B016WI7ICQ,5,This replacement option was so much less expensive than the HP alternative. So far the replacement works just like the original. I have not had it long enough to test its longevity. HP ink replacement works great
3915754,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I feel like printer ink is such a monopoly these days and they barely put any in a cartridge so the next thing you know, it's time to order again. When I saw this, it was a no brainer to give it a try. Sure enough, works just as well as the HP ink but way less expensive. Very happy with my purchase. They work just as good as the expensive name brand stuff!"
3915755,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I think the Ink Cartridges are great for such a cheap price
as to HP Ink Cartridges, I would tell my friends to order Jarbo Jarbo Ink Cartridges"
3915756,B016WI7ICQ,5,Much cheaper than the name brand refill and the quality honestly seems better.  I will definitely be reordering this as needed. Great quality refill
3915757,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Amazing deal on ink - Same quality as the HP ink, we don't see any difference. Definitely will buy again Will buy again"
3915758,B016WI7ICQ,4,"Doing a wonderful job when having to copy anything
in color. Print comes out very nice. Thank you.
Will reorder when need refill Jarbo 5 Color ink replacement"
3915759,B016WI7ICQ,5,I have now found my permanent supplier for my ink cartridges. I ordered 564XL cartridges for my HP 7510 photos art printer. They actually perform BETTER than the original HP cartridges. The colors are vibrant and they perform perfectly. And the price is amazing. Thank you JARBO. I love your product. SIX STARS
3915760,B016WI7ICQ,5,They fit the same as hp and print well. Only had for a short period but so far so good. Much cheaper alternative
3915761,B016WI7ICQ,4,"I gave this 4 stars because for my HP printer an error message pops up every time I go to print anything, otherwise purchasing these saved me some money. Ink"
3915772,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I've never ordered non-HP ink before, but after trying this product I'll not be going back to the name brand stuff. Works great, colors appear just as vibrant and true as HP branded cartridges. Great product for a great price! Works great!"
3915773,B016WI7ICQ,5,My first time using non HP cartridges but won't be the last. The printer recognizes that they are non HP during installation but I just press continue and the set up finishes without incident. Printed a few pages and all is well. For the savings compared to the original ink I will buy these again for sure Will certainly buy again
3915775,B016WI7ICQ,5,"First time buying ""alternative"" ink cartridges. Had some problems getting my printer to recognize these were installed, and initially the cyan cartridge seemed to want to ""bleed"" into the other colors (don't know if it's printer's fault or cartridge). One of the cartridges simply won't work with my printer, the printer doesn't ""see"" that it is there. But now they seem to be running fine and even with the one ""bad"" cartridge these are still a great deal. The color quality is excellent, documents and photos look great. Would definitely recommend and will buy again. Great value, some caveats"
3915776,B016WI7ICQ,1,Had purchased before so ordered some extra to have on hand.  When opened box found the two black xl cartridges were damaged but too late for a return.  Guess will not buy ahead any longer. Had purchased before so ordered some extra to have on ...
3915777,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Seem to work fine and considerably less than the ""real thing"".  Great source for cartridges for older machines. Great value"
3915778,B016WI7ICQ,1,"YOU will hate it Leaks,smears ,spots and comes off print on your hands  signed Black hand worst I've ever seen"
3915779,B016WI7ICQ,5,Ink cartridges work as expected! A great deal as you get 2 sets of cartridges for what 1 HP cartridge would cost. Very happy with these Great deal
3915780,B016WI7ICQ,5,I wish I would have found these cartridges before now!  They work just fine in my HP Photosmart 7520 They work just fine in my HP Photosmart
3915781,B016WI7ICQ,2,AFTER PUTTING YOUR COLOR REPLACEMENT IN  THE PRINTER THE COLOR ONES WERE  BUT THE BLACK WOULD NOT PRINT AND I TRIED TO PRINT SEVERAL WAYS AND DIFFERENT FORMS.

3915782,B016WI7ICQ,5,"After trying many of the discounted printer cartridges on Amazon, with a very spotty success rate, I thought I would try a company that actually stuck their name on their product. Success! Not a hitch and they print great. Finally, reasonably priced that works."
3915783,B016WI7ICQ,4,Working good.... Thanks Four Stars
3915784,B016WI7ICQ,4,Just received these a week ago. So far so good. Shipping was quick and the price is so much better than Original HP ink cartridges!

3915785,B016WI7ICQ,4,"i'm sorry I can not give you a higher score, because  I have not yet used any of them. I had just put new ink in my printer. But i'm sure they will do just fine. Had not tried yet !!"
3915786,B016WI7ICQ,5,Very pleased with this purchase. The price was much lower than I expected. And the seller follow up to ask if the product was acceptable. The toner I ordered is exactly what I needed & high quality!! Amazing Product & Service

3915804,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Great product, fast turn around. Five Stars"
3915805,B016WI7ICQ,5,"At first I struggled with these cartridges cause my printer didn't want to print.  I thought at one point since the printer said they weren't HP cartridges that Id have to purchase HP only.  I was a bit frustrated but then we got the colors to work so I was hopeful but the black still wouldnt budge for anything. We tried everything we could think of to get it to work, even let it sit for hours and still nothing. I then emailed Jarbo and let them know what was going on and asked for help.  Well I just received an email that said to wipe the chip with an eraser, make sure it was in the right position and it clicked when I put it in. Ill be honest using an eraser never once crossed my mind and thought at first it was a little strange but then I did it and Wha La, it worked!!!  Who would have ever thought a tiny little eraser would fix the problem!! If I could have reached through my laptop to hug the Jarbo customer service person, I would have!! Definitely a forever customer!! :-)"
3915806,B016WI7ICQ,5,"So far so good.  Prints very well, haven't tried too many photos though.  Such a savings over HP ink.  Will definitely buy again. Great value ink."
3915807,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Worth every scent. Instead of paying outrageous prices for HP ink, you get this amazing supply of ink for $20. I have so much ink now. It's awesome! They work GREAT!"
3915808,B016WI7ICQ,1,"This cartridge product was not compatible with my HP 564 Printer.  I had to go with the same cartridges, but a different brand.  Wasn't too satisfied with this one.  This product gets a rating of 1. Dissatisfied Unfortunately"

3915810,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Love the quality, service and price.  Couldn't ask for anything better.  The cartridges are see through, so you know you're getting a full ink cartridge.  The ink is not any different than HP cartridges. I've used the ink for many different printing jobs.  It works well with photo paper, letter head/ stationary papers, and regular print paper.  Hands down the very best for way less!!!

Update:  8/9/17  These cartridges are still the bomb!!!  I just changed my first set and I just finished a summer college English course.  Talk about all that printing for research, essays, etc.  Love these cartridges!!! Five Stars"
3915811,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I've used a lot of the non HP replacement cartridges, and so far these ar the best ones.  I've had all sorts of problems with them, none so far with these. Good product"
3915812,B016WI7ICQ,1,Horrible. Ink bled all over printer and colors were off. One Star
3915813,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I will never buy HP ink again. First off, I can't believe the amount of ink you get for the price. Especially compared to the ridiculous prices of name brands. Second, the ink prints perfectly. After about a month of printing, the black was starting to fade, however, my computer stated the ink was still full. I cleaned the print heads through the printer's settings and it was back to new. I will continue to buy this ink and the JARBO brand from here on out and have recommended it to family, friends, and colleagues. THANK YOU! Never buying HP ink again."
3915814,B016WI7ICQ,5,Ink works perfectly in my HP photosmart premium printer.  Dries quickly.  I would definitely order again. Very good ink for a reasonable price

This would seem to use more ink but the price probably compensates for that. After using 2 sets, I am pleased with results.  Color cartridges lasted 4 months while black lasted 2 months. used normal mode. Excellent buy for this price. Seems to work fine in normal mode but draft mode cause smears and ..."

3915853,B016WI7ICQ,5,"100% 5 star satisfied! I have an hp photosmart 7520, and as usual for all printers, ink is crazy expensive! I was a little worried about using this ink at first because it seemed too good to be true. But believe me, it is completely true! I didn't get any ink drops on me like other reviews have mentioned, just held the cartridge upside down while removing the orange tab and they were fine. Installation was not hard at all, they fit in perfectly like hp cartidges. My printer only complained about them not being ""genuine"" once and that was it. I ran the clean cartridges and alignment tools before printing anything, and I haven't noticed any difference in quality of prints at all. I will never buy hp ink again! AMAZING! MUST BUY!"
3915854,B016WI7ICQ,5,These are a great replacement option for printer cartridges. You definitely get your money's worth. I will definitely reorder. These are a great replacement option for printer cartridges

3915934,B016WI7ICQ,4,"Bought this almost 2 months ago, and gotta say so far it's pretty good. Hopefully it lasts longer the the pricey HP ink..
Negative: One big drawback is that the blacks look a lot more like a dark gray! Not sure if mines are defected or all of them are alike.

UPDATE: Shortly after my review I was contacted by one of their representatives asking me to provide further information regarding my issue. After running some tests, they have offered to send me another pack. Shipped quickly and the new ink is definitely better! Grayish blacks"
3915935,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works great in my old HP B210. Excellent Value
3915936,B016WI7ICQ,4,Super good color ink- except the black.  The black does not work for pictures & smears.  It is great for text!  I am very happy to find this ink! Good quality!
3915937,B016WI7ICQ,1,"When I saw these I was so excited the price was great!  All,of the reviews said how great they where and that they worked. Sadly, they did not work for me so I am back to HP only  Did work"

3915952,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I was looking for a alternative my $70 replacement ink. A quick search on Amazon and I came across the JARBO brand. After reading several reviews I decided to give them a shot, $23 for not one but two sets of color + 2 sets of black + 2 sets of photo color!!!! I figured if it was cheap ink I ark least I didn't spend much. I was not disappointed with this ink purchase at all! I don't do much color printing but I ran a few test prints and am wholly impressed. I have not gotten a chance to print any photos as I just ran out of photo paper but I'm sure JARBO ink is equally stunning on photo prints.

I will definitely be buying JARBO ink in the future! Excellent ink! Highly recommend!"

3915957,B016WI7ICQ,5,These inks work well in my HP printer. Quality is great and a lot cheaper than HP inks. Great value
3915958,B016WI7ICQ,4,"One of the black XL cartridges arrived leaking in it's sealed plastic wrap so I won't be using that one, but the other cartridges work great in my HP printer. Color is just as vibrant as the OEM ink and even though the printer complains that ""non-OEM ink is installed"" it works without problems and still shows the ink levels on the printers status screen.

Its a bummer one cartridge was faulty, but honestly considering how much cheaper these inks are than HP cartridges and how well they have been working it really isn't a big deal for me. Good, inexpensive ink that works as advertised."
3915959,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Only used 1 color so far, but it has worked as well as the HP cartridges at a substantial savings. Excellent JARBO replacement HP ink."
3915960,B016WI7ICQ,4,"I ordered these largely based on other reviews that said they worked as well as HP cartridges and were far less money. I have only used two so far but they have worked perfectly. The cartridges are clear so you can see they are full when you get them. The color is good and even. And the price is right if you use a lot of ink like I do. Shipping was fast. I will order again. Good ink, good price"

3915994,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works perfect with hp 7520 Five Stars
3915995,B016WI7ICQ,5,WHY or why have I not purchased these before. It was either $70 for four of HP or 10 of these. Print is excellent and it's nice seeing that the cartridges are FULL of ink. I have always wondered about the HP inks. The plastic cover is SO MUCH easier to remove. Now I no longer want to purchase another brand printer to save on ink. So happy I made this purchase. Wonderful Inks! Amazing savings.
3915997,B016WI7ICQ,5,was a lil afraid to try. have to say the work great Five Stars

3916012,B016WI7ICQ,5,This is best price I have seen for ink.  It seems to work fine well in my printer.  The on board ink level display shows all cartridges are full and the quality report is good. Best Price by Far!

3916070,B016WI7ICQ,4,"Great deal, but the Photo cartridge (despite the image in the photo and the ""this fits your printer"" description on Amazon) does NOT fit my B209a printer. But the price is great even considering. I just don't know what to do with these 2 extra cartridges.

I opened a black cartridge and it did spill over and I got it on both hands - not too much, but still annoying. I managed to clean up the cartridge and get it installed. The warranty is long past, so I don't care about voiding it, but it still doesn't register the ink levels. They just have a question mark next to them. Great price"
3916071,B016WI7ICQ,5,Why did I not know about these?! Great price and prints just like an hp Something reliable and great Will only purchase my ink with you guys and recommending to my family members Great price and prints just like an hp Something reliable ...
3916073,B016WI7ICQ,5,Excellent deal. Works very well for my printing. Five Stars
3916074,B016WI7ICQ,1,My HP 7520 refuses to print with this ink installed.  The ink is worthless if it won't work in the printer.  I'll have to be without my printer till I can get some ink cartridges that actually work. Worthless Junk!
3916075,B016WI7ICQ,4,"The quality of the ink itself is quite good. It's not something that can be used to print high quality images but for my purpose of printing large sets of documents, it's perfect.

I use a HP photosmart premium c309a printer and this did not work on it off the box. Luckily i had the original auto reset chips and after replacing them on the cartridge, I got it to work.

EDIT 5/5/2017: I received an email from JARBO which was very nice of them to voluntarily email me with a suggestion. I really don't know what to reply to their email. I will be ordering a few more sets of this ink in the very near future as I am very happy with my purchase.

""This is Amy from JARBO after service. I saw the review you left, sorry for the delay response as I spent a hard way to get your contact information, because Amazon has protected customer information. I am very sorry we can not bring you a pleasant purchasing experience.

3916090,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Cartridges worked just fine.  Of course, HP print Apps pop up with an error you just have to ignore, otherwise, that minor inconvenience is worth it to not pay crazy ink prices. Good to go."
3916092,B016WI7ICQ,5,Packing was well secured. Cartridges installed perfectly. Printer alerted they were not original HP but allowed use and they work great. Great price work great
3916093,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Based on what you get for the price you get it, this is hands down a great deal. The only problem is the factory printer will give you a warning message that the ink is not from an approved brand (which is basically their brand). I will never buy factory branded ink again!"
3916094,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works great and awesome price! Five Stars
3916095,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Works perfectly fine with my HP photosmart premium C410a. Printer recognised that this is a non hp cartridge, but absolutely no issues with printing. Value for money. Value for money, prints perfectly."

3916115,B016WI7ICQ,1,The colored cartridges seemed to work fine. I installed the black cartridge and it seemed fine at first but after a few days it started to not print that great.

3916143,B016WI7ICQ,5,"When I became fed up with the expensive cartridges that HP was selling, I found these cartridges that contained many cartridges for a very cheap price. So far, they have been working great in my printer. The prints looks high quality, just like the ones from HP. I highly recommend this and would buy it again. Excellent Price, Quality Prints"
3916144,B016WI7ICQ,1,"This product was horrible. It stated off well but now it is just broken. Everything that prints black or white comes out a weird tint of yellowish/green, even when I had sufficient ink. This is not okay. Even after, I tried to contact the seller but there was no phone number to be found. Would not buy ever again. I demand replacements. Do Not Buy! - Horrible Product"
3916145,B016WI7ICQ,1,"I'll start by saying that this is the first review on Amazon I've ever left because it's also the first Amazon purchase I've made that was a huge waste of money and time on a catastrophically horrible product. I have always purchased HP cartridges because I didn't want to deal with the hassle of an off brand product not working or causing issues. Lo and behold, it seems I was right in that train of thought. This time, I researched several different options and looked at the reviews before purchasing this product because it seemed, from the reviews, to be a reputable product that would actually work. I used my printer just before replacing my (almost) empty HP brand cartridges and it worked just as it always has but now it won't work at all with the JARBO cartridges. I aligned the cartridges and cleaned the cartridge heads prior to trying to print because I knew there would be a slight variation in quality with the different brands. That worked so I thought I'd made a good choice...until it came time to actually trying to print anything at all. Not once have I ever had an issue with this printer (not even with having it connected wirelessly to two separate computers) and, as a college student, I use my printer quite often. Luckily I'm still within the return window, but that doesn't make up for the fact that I now have to buy an entirely new printer simply because I was trying to save money. I hate how much the HP cartridges cost, but I will absolutely continue to buy them just for the piece of mind that they will work as advertised and not destroy the printer. Save money on cartridges...but now have to fork over more money for brand new printer"
3916146,B016WI7ICQ,5,The cartridges work well in my HP inkjet and I had no error issues loading JARBO works well
3916147,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works Great Five Stars

3916149,B016WI7ICQ,5,work just fine. a message popped up on my printer that HP cant guarantee the quality of non HP ink...seriously they work fine. I also like how the plastic casing was transparent and I can literally see how much ink is left in the cartridge great ink
3916160,B016WI7ICQ,5,"So far, it is indistinguishable from the ink that came with the printer. Five Stars"
3916161,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These replacement cartridges work just as good as OEM for a fraction of the cost.

3916167,B016WI7ICQ,5,I've used these replacement cartridges and have found no difference between HP originals and  the JARBO cartridges. I would order these again. JARBO replacement cartrigees

I'll save a ton of money by not printing anything at all....."
3916173,B016WI7ICQ,5,I bought this item thinking it was worth the try for the price. It works great! I will absolutly order this again . It works great! I will absolutly order this again
3916174,B016WI7ICQ,1,"I took a chance with a third party ink to save some money.  What I've experienced is not do do so.  As a professional, I expect when I buy something, it will live up to my high level of expectations.  I found that this ink would smear occasionally and leave marks on the top of the pages.  Today, I was exchanging the last of the ink cartridges in the printer, I found that it covered my fingers.  Attempted to clean it off with no success.  I return to my desk to find it had leaked on to my desk where I left the empty cartridge.  I was able to get it off my desk with alcohol, but not my fingers.  I'm not impressed as tonight, I will be delivering an analysis to my client with my fingers covered in ink.  Attached photo's will show ""after"" I did an initial wipe off my desk. Messy Disaster & Embarrassing Results"
3916175,B016WI7ICQ,1,these replacement cartridges did not work with the HP printer that it was bought for. too late to return them but this was really a bust. sorry for this negative review but it is just the truth as an experience. Just did not work.
3916176,B016WI7ICQ,4,So far this ink works very good.  Prob not great for professional / photo printing but for what we need at home it's a perfect low cost solution So far this ink works very good. Prob not great for professional / photo printing ...

3916190,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works well Five Stars
3916191,B016WI7ICQ,5,"So far everything is great! I love that the cartridge is clear and I can see that they are full when they arrived. Print quality is exactly how it was with the HP ink Great replacement, awesome cost"
3916192,B016WI7ICQ,4,"These cartridges may take some finagling. The Cyan & regular black I put into my printer showed up as possibly damaged according to my 7510 printer, and unfortunately that is the error message you can't dismiss. Luckily, I had some old cartridges I could pull the chip off of in order to make these work, but then the ink level doesn't properly show. If you don't have spare chips handy, an error message like this is going to make the cartridges unusable for you. If you do experience this, I suggest installing one cartridge at a time as I was originally getting this message on all cartridges. But the yellow, magenta, and photo black ended up being fine & only identified as non-HP ink (which can be ignored).

All cartridges were shipped to me in perfect physical condition - no leaking as some pictures from other buyers show.

I did notice some ink splatter inside my printer where the ink head normally rests when not in use. I had cleaned this area out before getting this set of ink so I know the splatter came from this set of cartridges. I'll just have to wait and see how much more is leaked as they are used.

After printing every diagnostic sheet available, the print quality does seem to be very decent. I even printed a picture on photo paper, and I'm fairly satisfied with that (although I personally don't print many such pictures).

All in all, this was kind of borderline for me sending back. I'm only not because I was able to get it to work for me. Still, I doubt I'll buy these again. I've heard worse horror stories buying recycled ink, however. Inexpensive, but flawed"
3916193,B016WI7ICQ,1,"Leaked all over the interior of our printer. Not sure if it is related, but our printer broke. We had to go get a new one. Warning! Leaked!"
3916194,B016WI7ICQ,5,"So far, ink works as it should. Can't beat the price! Five Stars"

3916213,B016WI7ICQ,5,"This is the first time that I have used this brand of cartridges and I find that they are very good. I get nice crisp printing from them. The colors are accurate, as well. I saved quite a bit on this purchase and am happy about that. They work well with my HP All In One. I would definitely order again. Really Good Product"
3916214,B016WI7ICQ,5,I was impressed with these. They worked great in my HP smart photo printer. No compatibility issues. I like that they are clear so you can see that they are complete full when they arrive. I printed over 800 sheets of paper on a black cartridge. They worked great in my HP smart photo printer
3916215,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I have a HP 5510. Been using it for 2 days now. All colors (black, cyan, yellow, magenta) fit in perfectly and prints well. Price is 3x less than genuine product. Will update if any changes.

The only recommendation to the company is that HP 5510 does not carry photo black ink (I know other compatible printers do). If you can eliminate that for this specific model and maybe make it cheaper, that would be great (and it saves your company some money too). Nonetheless, I'll still purchase this if all goes well. So far, so good."
3916216,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Awesome product, price, and the company followed up with me to make sure I was happy with the ink!! Five Stars"
3916217,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works great! No complaints. Love the price!! Good stuff
3916218,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I had very low expectations that this ink would perform as well as the name-brand HP ink.
To my surprise, it's ALMOST there.

For general printing, you can't go wrong. There is nothing noticeably different between this and the name brand ink.

For photo printing, the colors are slightly off and not as crisp. BUT, still acceptable if you're just looking to crank out photos.

FYI - the printer does give me a warning saying that the ink is not genuine, but it does not prevent it from functioning. Very pleased with performance and price"
3916219,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I love these inks.  They are quite a bit cheaper than the brand ink, but they work just as well, if not better.  Thank you so much JARBO for an amazing product. I love these inks"
3916230,B016WI7ICQ,1,"Garbage.  Streaky, lines, everything you can imagine would go wrong does.  If you don't purchase HP ink cartridges, it's going to print like garbage. Garbage. Streaky"
3916231,B016WI7ICQ,4,"First time using non-HP cartridges.  So far, work fine.  Price is great. Like non-HP Printer Cartridges, Price Great!"
3916232,B016WI7ICQ,5,Really good ink cartridge replacement for HP 564. Worked perfectly with my Deskjet printer and great print quality. Highly recommend this and I will be using a lot more of these in the future as it so very reasonably priced for this quality! Great product and reasonably priced
3916233,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Pretty simple, took a chance for the price and was beyond happy, great quality and actually had a follow-up email to make sure everything was good. worth the money/ great quality"
3916234,B016WI7ICQ,5,"one of the extra large cartridges leaked all over within its packaging.  not able to use it. hoping they will send me another to replace it. otherwise, it's good and they are working well.  great prices.

3916238,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These seem to work very well. I've only printed about a dozen pages, but so far I can't tell any difference from OE cartridges. Very good so far."
3916239,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Received in sort order and, installed into my printer. I am getting notices that the ink is not original HP but, it continues to print without any issues. The color is fantastic and in my opinion may even be better than the high price hp ink. So far I love it and will definitely continue to purchase this brand. Great Quality ink"
3916250,B016WI7ICQ,5,colors are brilliant.  the best thing is that i am able to see the ink level on my computer.  some generic cartridges do not show their levels so it is a guessing game when a new cartridge will be needed soon.  i don't think i will ever buy the expensive HP ink cartridges again. colors are brilliant. the best thing is that i am able ...
3916251,B016WI7ICQ,5,Easy to order / no problems with installation / will order again! worth the price

3916253,B016WI7ICQ,5,We just got these cartridges. They fit right. Ink seems like it's of excellent quality. Easy to open (which some are decidedly not!) so far we are very pleased with quality and price. Will review again later on how long they last. Great quality. Great price!
3916254,B016WI7ICQ,4,So far the Jarbo Ink Cartridges have worked well. I'm giving it 4 out of 5 stars simply because I haven't seen how long the ink lasts and if it continues to perform well. For now I give it a solid thumbs up! So far the Jarbo Ink Cartridges have worked well. ...
3916255,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works as advertised if not better. I loaded them in and acknowledged the warning and pressed ok and they work flawless.

3916259,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I have just installed my first set of Jarbo printer cartridges in our hp printer. It appears that they are going to work out just fine. We don't actually print often as we use our printer mostly for scan and fax, but I did not want to pay the high price of the hp cartridges. The Jarbo inks appear to be clear, with nice, dark blacks and good color saturation. Jarbo to save money"
3916270,B016WI7ICQ,5,"This is much better than original HP Ink Cartridge. Never look back on HP originals, refills, etc. Never look back on HP originals, refills, etc."
3916271,B016WI7ICQ,1,Color was very diluted! Could not get a good picture! HP printer rejects
3916272,B016WI7ICQ,5,"So far these ink replacements are working great in my HP Photosmart 7520. I haven't printed pictures so not sure about that but don't see a recognizable difference in my regular printing. Glad I took the gamble cause now I'll be saving a lot of $$$

UPDATE: The best buy ever! last a long time and prints very well. So glad I found this deal and hope it sticks around. A huge savings! HP Photosmart 7520 works well no noticeable difference"

3916274,B016WI7ICQ,5,I have purchased printer ink on line in the past but stopped because the quality just wasn't there. There was always some problem. I tried again but this time I was very pleasantly surprised. The Cartridges fit my HP printer just fine and the colors are very good. 5 Stars Great Choice
3916275,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These cartridges worked great on my HP printer!  No difference in printing between HP and JARBO cartridges, except for the significant cost savings.  Will definitely continue to buy JARBO. Highly recommended!!!"

3916312,B016WI7ICQ,5,"They work just with my HP Deskjet3522. It originally said ""non-HP cartridge installed"" so I clicked ok. Then the printer told me the cartridge had to be removed. I just took it out and put it back in and it works with no problems. HP Deskjet 3522 series (minor issues)"

3916315,B016WI7ICQ,4,You can not beat this price! Our printer is a few years old but we aren't ready to buy a new one. It does sound different while printing using this ink but still prints great! Will definitely be buying again!
3916316,B016WI7ICQ,5,Great replacement for my hp cartridges. Good color and seem to last. Five Stars
3916317,B016WI7ICQ,4,I ordered it after reading the product review. Finally find a substitute for the pricy HP ink. The colors come out nicely. Love it. Worth to try

3916337,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I have tried other refills from Amazon, they all leaked from the XL size cartidge. These guys did not, worked fine, came quickly, I will use them in future.

Follow up - still working fine few months later. these don't leak, good quality"
3916338,B016WI7ICQ,1,The ink smeared on all pages. Print quality was terrible. This was a complete waste of money. Had to go buy HP cartridges Don't do it!!

3916351,B016WI7ICQ,5,"i gotta admit, i have had buyers remorse for buying this hp photosmart printer since i ran out of ink, the original ink cartridges are outrageous. when i seen these i though why not? its only 25 bucks? so when they came in i was concerned they would leak on me, or all up in my printer, but nooooooo. they worked perfectly! great product for a more than great price. i will be ordering more when these run out! better than expected"
3916352,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Had product for a couple of weeks.  I use the printer ink daily for work... Ink works like a champ.  Printer said doesn't recognize the ink, yet it still printed... no ink run... i reccommend this for a cheaper reliable ink replacement.  I will be reordering when im low on ink. You must try before you doubt replacement ink!!!"
3916353,B016WI7ICQ,5,"The cartridges working very well, they are very full with Ink and would definitely recommend this seller. they are very full with Ink and would definitely recommend this seller"

3916356,B016WI7ICQ,5,The cartridges worked phenomenally.  All I had to do was hit ok when the printer displayed the message of not being HP cartridges. Great product; I'm sold for life.
3916357,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These are great replacement cartridges for HP printer.  The ink quality is as good as HP brand, for a fraction of the cost!  Cartridges come individually packaged in clear wrapper lined up in a box for easy identification.  The cartridges are clear which makes it very easy to see when they are ""truly"" empty.

Very Fast Shipping.  Would definitely purchase again from this seller. GREAT REPLACEMENT CARTRIDGES.  INK QUALITY SAME AS BRAND NAME!"
3916358,B016WI7ICQ,5,Wonderful product and very economical! Five Stars
3916359,B016WI7ICQ,5,Only replaced the black cartridge to date but it is working well! So far so good!
3916370,B016WI7ICQ,5,I highly recommend the Jarbo replacement ink.  I purchased this product and I am extremely happy with the quality and performance of the ink in my HP 7500 ink jet printer.  Getting ripped off for brand name toner is no longer an issue when reputable companies offer substitute high quality ink cartridges.  Thank you Jarbo! Excellent Replacement Ink!
3916371,B016WI7ICQ,5,Great product.  Worked good.  Fraction of the price of new!!!  Thanks. Five Stars
3916372,B016WI7ICQ,4,"After taking the ink cartridges and slamming them in and taking them out a few times before my printer would read them, the ink cartridges are NOW working good. It was almost like I had to trick my printer into excepting something new. But the ink quality themselves are like i am using hp cartridge. I will be ordering more, thanks. they are great"

3916374,B016WI7ICQ,5,Good replacement ink -works great - good value. Five Stars
3916375,B016WI7ICQ,5,"So far, amazing!!! A fraction of the usual price. Fast delivery. Well-packaged  (cartridges were sealed in plastic wrap). Our printouts seem to be the same quality as with the shockingly expensive  'brand name' cartridges. If the cost stays this competitive, and the print quality stays consistent, we'll definitely be ordering ALL of our ink from these folks. A surprising find. :-) Great!!"
3916376,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I use a HP Photosmart 5520 printer. Once I inserted the cartridges in the printer carriage I received the message warning that I wasn't installing authentic HP ink. I just pressed OK and the printer accepted them. I then ran a print quality diagnosis, cleaned the print head and ran the alignment tool, scanned the alignment page and everything is good. I honestly can't tell the difference between authentic HP cartridges and the Jarbo cartridges- the quality is that good. Best of all Jarbo has great customer service. I received a email from Amy, at Jarbo, wanting to know how I felt about the product and if I had any concerns to feel free to contact them at any time. Jarbo  cartridges seem to be working well in my HP printer and you can't beat the customer service or price. Thanks Jarbo Good quality & customer service"
3916377,B016WI7ICQ,1,"I thought getting off brand ink at a better price was too good to be true! I have a 7520 and I installed the cartridges and it gives a message that something is wrong and then it says turn off printer and retry. No other option at all. I reinstalled and still the same thing. Now, if I could send these back and get my money back. Looks like I am back to spending a lot of money for Ink cartridges! Doesn't work!"
3916378,B016WI7ICQ,4,I'm very pleased with the ink cartridges so far. The color and crispness appears to be better than the manufacturer's brand. Looking forward to working on my printing projects with these! I'm very pleased with the ink cartridges so far
3916379,B016WI7ICQ,5,Cartridges worked great! No difference in color or quality than factory ink at a fraction of the price. Will definitely continue with JARBO ink cartridges! Perfect!
3916400,B016WI7ICQ,5,The cartridges fit perfectly and work wonderfully.  Nothing more I can say - just really pleased. Five Stars
3916401,B016WI7ICQ,5,excellent !! Five Stars
3916402,B016WI7ICQ,1,Terrible product. I started the return process and then needed to print my label again and I had to cancel the return and reopen it and now it states that the return window is closed. It came leaking in the box and the other boxes had pale ink. This is a terrible product. Don't buy
3916403,B016WI7ICQ,5,"This ink was a great price and - I had to shake my head - kept making copy after copy long after I expected it to run out. The colors stayed true also, which was important as I was printing photographs for a family collage.  Thank you JARBO! This ink was a great price and - I had to shake my head ..."
3916404,B016WI7ICQ,5,Photo smart C310 gives message this are not HP Ink cart. but it works just fine. Five Stars
3916405,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works great no problems. Much happier paying this amount vs printer manufacturer prices. Worth it!
3916406,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works great and much cheaper! Five Stars
3916407,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Can't beat the value.  I was hesitant to purchase non OEM ink, but this seems to be doing the job.  Will purchase again. Great alternative to store prices for brand name ink"
3916408,B016WI7ICQ,4,"They work just fine and I'll be purchasing more in the future. Thank you for saving me money, I will no longer pay the overpriced amounts HP charges. They work just fine and I'll be purchasing more in the future"

3916411,B016WI7ICQ,5,"The ink is performing great at this point.  We've printed around 50 pages so far without any issues.
Would buy this product again.  And will recommend the company to friends. The ink is performing great at this point"
3916412,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Didn't want to blow a ton of money on HP ink and figured I would give these a try.  Needed to print golden script on 170 envelopes for my daughter.  These arrived in 2 days.  I popped them in and got the warning that these weren't ""official hp cart"" and then went to town.  Very happy with the results.  Ink color reproduction was good, and had no issues with smearing.  Will use these from now on Great ink, no issues"
3916413,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Very happy with this ink.  Since I installed the XL black cartridge, I have seen one document early on that had an ink drop appear on it.  But even that document was unharmed, and I haven't seen any imperfections in the printing since then.  I will update this review if needed, but you just can't beat the price!  And you get two sets of all colors including photo black, and EACH SET comes with TWO of the black XL cartridges (the ones that are working most of the time you're printing). Looking good"
3916414,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Based on my experience, these were the best HP replacements cartridges that I have used. Got an HP? These are 4 U!!"

3916418,B016WI7ICQ,5,Excellent product.  Ink cartridges are working great.  Very satisfied...will purchase again Great ink cartridges
3916419,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I really like the ink I received.  It prints clear with no smudging or dullness, if that makes sense.  I think it prints better than the name brand product.  It was really a good buy for me. I really like the ink I received"
3916420,B016WI7ICQ,5,very good Five Stars
3916421,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Surprisingly, these work very well.  The price is so low that I was reluctant to purchase them.  I installed an entire set of cartridges right away to make sure they were going to work.  I did have an issue with the black but I contacted the company and they responded immediately with a resolution to my problem.  I have been using these cartridges for over a month now and they have been working perfectly.  I am so excited - I will never pay full price again for the expensive HP cartridges or face the hassle of having them refilled!  This option costs even less than getting your cartridges refilled at Costco. Work perfectly - Never pay full price again!"
3916422,B016WI7ICQ,1,"Horrible product. After printing less than 50 pages, had to use second set of canisters. Don't waste your time and/or money. Horrible product. After printing less than 50 pages"
3916423,B016WI7ICQ,5,work well good
3916425,B016WI7ICQ,4,"I just purchased a 10 cart. Set. When i put in the Pblack in my printer (HP7520) it immediately stated it wasn't a genuine hp ink cartridge, which was no problem in truth. .BUT then it said my printer head was defective or missing.. oh no!!! After cleaning it and reinstalling it, it seems to work fine now. I did the print test and so far it looks ok. After using for awhile i will update this review but i am a bit nervious that i may have damaged my printer in my desire to save a bit of money...only time will tell
Revision:
My printer wasn't happy when I first inserted these cartridges but once I tweeked it a bit, the printer accepted them without a problem. I have been using them a week now and they are ok...the color could be a bit more brilliant but hey! I'm saving a bundle...I still wouldn't recommend them if you're printed photos though. ok but not for photos"
3916426,B016WI7ICQ,1,"I purchased this ink for my HP Photosmart 7520. I figured I'd give it a try and maybe save some money over the way more expensive HP cartridges. BIG MISTAKE if you are planning on printing pictures. The pics will look nothing like they are supposed to. I then purchased genuine HP ink, and back to gorgeous pics again. Now, that said, if you are using it for standard printing, you are good to go. But, again, I cannot emphasize enough, this product is POOR at printing photos. I read that it is because these replacements use ""dye ink"" and not ""pigment ink"". Fortunately, Amazon is great with returns, so no loss here, but at least it was a worthwhile exercise to learn the differences. This IS one of those ""you only get what you pay for"" times. NOT GOOD FOR PRINTING PHOTOS"
3916427,B016WI7ICQ,5,"They work great, and are not throwing any error messages Five Stars"
3916428,B016WI7ICQ,1,Leaked all over and printed very spotty. Returned for a refund. One Star

3916431,B016WI7ICQ,1,This product worked on the first 7 copies I made and after three days I came back to print more and the Black ink is barely noticeable and illegible after trying 20 copies. Waste of $$$$
3916432,B016WI7ICQ,5,Great quality! Great product! Great price! Love the JARBO ink. Love JARBO!
3916433,B016WI7ICQ,5,This is my first time not using the HP ink cartridges. I couldn't believe the quality and the quantity at such a great price! Work great!
3916435,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These ink cartridges are wonderful. No leaks great color. They came a lot faster than expected. Very easy to Install. My printer did notify me once that they were not HP but one click for ok and one click for do not notify me again . And that was solved. I won't be waisting my money on other inks anymore I will be ordering Inks from these guys.
5 for service
5 for quality
10/10 all around for this product.. !! GREAT BUY!"
3916436,B016WI7ICQ,1,"Disappointed!  I was very excited to hopefully find a discounted price for printer ink.  Well this isn't it!  I tried every black cartridge and not one of them would print!  I didn't have any problem with the color cartridges, hence the 1 star review.  Returned. Disappointed"
3916437,B016WI7ICQ,1,"When I first bought these, I was so excited. I'm a teacher, and I print a lot at home and use a ton of ink. These seemed to be an answer to my prayer......inexpensive ink!!! Fantastic! Until the black completely stopped printing. I tried everything to fix it. Only solution was to get a new printer!!!! Just read the someone else's review and  exact same thing happened to them! Buyer beware!! Beware!!"

3916444,B016WI7ICQ,1,"2 of the black cartridges leaked out in the plastic bags.  The other 2 did not work in the printer even after repeated head cleaning and aligning.  And they did leak some ink in the printer.  The 3 color cartridges did work with no leaking.  Get what you pay for it looks like.  Well not even with these.  Pay the price and get the real deal. Nope, don't risk it."
3916446,B016WI7ICQ,5,"So far I have only replaced the black ink in my hp 5520 printer, but it was a perfect fit and works great.

I mainly used the black ink,barely used the color,and when I did use the color,within 2 weeks,it called for new ink. Was spending almost $ 70.00. LOve this ink."

3916457,B016WI7ICQ,5,Great product at a fraction of the price the printer companies are trying to charge for ink. Thank you JARBO! Great product at a fraction of the price the printer ...
3916458,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Excellent! This is the first time that I order a different brand than HP and the quality of the ink is great.
I will definitely be ordering more ink. Also the price was good. I find it ridiculous to have to spend $49 for brand ink so this is the best buy you can get. Excellent quality and price."
3916459,B016WI7ICQ,5,Good product. Great price. We'll wait to see how many copies we get from ink cartridges.  Excellent communication from tracking product. Amazon does it again

3916461,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Very pleased. Two complete sets for $22! They had none of the problems that others had commented on. Pop 'em in, skip over the message that the printer warns you that these are not the super high priced HP ink cartridge and you are in business! Very pleased. Two complete sets for $22"
3916462,B016WI7ICQ,5,This was the BEST find and most amazing purchase. No problems with my HP 6515. Saved sooo much money. This was the BEST find and most amazing purchase
3916463,B016WI7ICQ,5,Replaced all cartridges with these and had no issues at all. Prints documents and photos beautifully. Got the warning from the printer that I wasn't using genuine HP cartridges and quality wasn't guaranteed. In actuality I think the quality was better considering the reason I was out of ink was because I burned the HP ones out trying to get a decent photo out of it. These printed photos fine right out of the gate. For the price it's a no brained that these will be my go to replacements for now on! Prints documents and photos beautifully. Got the warning from the printer that I ...
3916465,B016WI7ICQ,4,"They seem to work great for your average printing. The kids use it all the time for their homework. The only concern I have, which I did email the company but was unable to get a straight answer, is that the photo black and black cartridges are labelled incorrectly. The photo black is the skinnier cartridge and the black is the wider cartridge and this should be the other way around. I don't know if it's just mismarked or the inks are
just the same. I was not impressed with the picture I printed. Overall I can't complain, I'm getting two sets of inks for the price of one HP cartridge. I'll probably just buy the HP photo black for any serious photo printing. Great ink at a great price..."
3916466,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Arrived very quickly, fit nicely and work just as well as the HP cartridges I buy for much more. This is a huge money saver for my wife, who prints heavily for work and school both. fit nicely and work just as well as the HP cartridges ..."

3916479,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Installed a set of these cartridges today.  Printed a clean print heads page and everything appears to be working well.  If these hold up for the duration of their usage I will have found a new replacement ink cartridge company as this order came with 2 full sets of XL series ink cartridges as well as 2 additional XL Black ink cartridges and 2 Photo Black ink cartridges.  To be honest I do not plan on ever using the Photo Black cartridges, but the price alone for these sets of ink cost less than 1 individual XL Black ink cartridge from HP.  I will post future updates if anything relevant arises. Excellent Price Point for Replacement Ink Cartridges"

3916482,B016WI7ICQ,5,"What a fabulous product! The cartridges come packaged very neatly in a small box, with two of each color, even Photo Black. This is a very good value. There is much less packaging to throw away with these cartridges also. Each cartridge is in one plastic bag, which has a notch in it so I could just tear it open. I didn't even need scissors! When I used the ""original manufacturer"" ink cartridge and replaced them, I would have a box to dispose of, an envelope, several paper inserts, etc. etc. That may seem like a small detail but I appreciate the spare packaging. These cartridges fit perfectly and print clear crisp colors.

I bought this set because of the low price and the great reviews and I had to have them right after Christmas.  (Spent to much on Christmas gifts.)  I am so glad that I did.  These are high quality replacement in cartridges.  The colors are vivid and worked perfectly the first time I put them in.  I am so glad that I gave them a try.

3916497,B016WI7ICQ,5,I finally put these in my printer and used them for the first time to make Christmas cards today. Some cards had a ton of color and picture collages so the color had to be precise.  I was thrilled that the colors were vibrant and didn't run.  They were crisp and perfect on every card.  The price for this ink is excellent as well and this company will be my go to for ink from now on. Crisp and clear printing with exact color. Great price

3916504,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Works just as well as brand-name ink. I noticed it doesn't work as well when using a draft print mode when first using the cartridges, but eventually catches up and stops smearing and missing spots when using draft print. Cartridges seem to last longer than name-brand ones. I will be buying these from now on.

EDIT: A little over a year later I bought my second set because I finally used the other ink. This is by far the best value for ink. I would've spent 3-4 times as much in ink on HP brand. These work just as good! Works just as well as brand-name ink. I noticed ..."

I've tried printing lots of things, tried doing the settings (numerous times) of aligning printer head, cleaning printer head, etc. nothing helps.
Just paid a fortune over the weekend for replacement HP brand ink & now works perfectly.
Do yourself a favor, buy the legit stuff, these just give you hassle of constantly telling you it's not an original HP ink cartridge (a message that never cleared for me unless I turned off my printer) & horrible streaky, ink blot mess,
Worst decision I ever made buying these! Run the other way! Don't make the mistake I did!"

As new parents in this generation, I still feel we need to do it right and have pictures all over our house of our son and the price and quality of ink make it soooo easy. We are definitely buying it again, and will continue to recommend it to our friends and family. I love the ink"
3916576,B016WI7ICQ,1,Bought it in June right after a move.  Just a got a chance try this worthless ink.  Messed my HP 7520 up royally. Printer didn't recognize it one at a time.  I got fed up trying to get it to work so I bought HP 564XL at full retail and after trying to get this crap to work the HP ink wouldn't either.  2 days later I got the HP ink to work.

I unloaded all of my genuine HP ink cartridges and inserted these as a set. As soon as I put these in my printer, they began leaking all over the printer heads and paper. My printer no longer works at all. It will not print from the black cartridge at all and all of the colors are very light. I would not recommend buying off-brand print cartridges ever again.

3916607,B016WI7ICQ,5,I wasn't sure about this product after reading some of the reviews. I was wrong. These cartridges perform as good or better than HP. What a deal on the price. I will be sticking with Jarbo for all future ink  cartridge  replacements. Excellent cartridge at a good price!

3916609,B016WI7ICQ,5,Used the replacement cartridges for the first time they worked great. No difference other than a huge savings.

3916610,B016WI7ICQ,2,The black and the yellow worked.  One out of two of the blue and red worked.  Printer wouldn't read them or recognize there was anything installed. At least they're cheap.
3916611,B016WI7ICQ,5,Was hesitant at first but cartridges produced great colors with no malfunction at all. I would recommend Jarbo Inks and will continue to purchase more in the future.

3916618,B016WI7ICQ,4,They worked in my printer.  No issues.  After buying HP ink over and over again I decided to give this a try.  HP ink is almost 9 times the cost of this ink.  So it looks like this is the way to go. They seem to work
3916619,B016WI7ICQ,4,The product here works as advertised. This is all I want it to do. Thank goodness the courts finally straightened out HP. No more strong-arm interrupt from HP telling me that I have to use their products exclusively. Broken Strongarm

3916626,B016WI7ICQ,2,"Jarbo had hounded me for a while to leave a review, but I didn't want to write a review without fully using the ink. Well, here goes...
It works  simply put, they fit well in the printer and print documents well. The issue comes in when printing large images that require significant amounts of ink.  Particularly the black.  After printing an image I found that the black fades out and immediate subsequent images have worse results. But switch back to printing a text document and the black works fine. Print a test report and it prints fine. Go back to the image and the black fades out.  See related image.

**UPDATE**  I recently needed to print a 2""x2"" photo on semi-gloss photo paper for an ID.  After multiple attempts I had to go to a (formerly known as) Kinkos to print the picture.  The photo came out with a VERY red tint to it or worse no matter how I tried to edit it.  I purchased HP cartridges and put them back into the printer, viola, it printed just fine. **UPDATE** Does not print large images or photos well"
3916627,B016WI7ICQ,1,"Would not recommend due to two ink cartridges created a problem with true or correct color print out.
Both cartridges had plenty of ink left, but it seems the ic chips create a problem after time. The first time I did not think much about it. The second time I'm very annoyed, no more non HP cartridges. They worked for a month or two, maybe three? I do not print a whole lot. Will not buy again."

I threw away my CISS setup because the ink kept getting air bubbles and would retract constantly.  I'm keeping with these replacement cartridges from now on. Do not use CISS, go with these."

3916643,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Great product. Bought these for my HP Photosmart 5525 all-in-one. Fit perfectly and were recognized by the printer. Ran the alignment test - perfect! The only caveat is that you must set the printer to accept cartridges that are not ""Genuine HP"", but I always use that setting. I got two complete sets of ink (2 black XL, 6 color XL) with two additional XL Black for approximately 11% cost of ""Genuine HP"". Good bye HP! No More Overpriced HP Ink!"

I needed to print our resumes to do interviews for my business and these don't work,  printers will not see them as legit ink cartridges.  After got printer to see them finally with software, they leaked all over and I had to buy a new printer for my resumes etc.  Learned my lesson.  I can't have the kids use the printer even for school work.  Went ahead and got a laser jet monochrome so I don't have to worry about not being able to produce papers.

3916654,B016WI7ICQ,4,"I ordered the JARBO 5 Cartridge Replacement HP 5645XL for my older HP 410 Photosmart Premium printer. I had been using it lately for printing documents because of the cost of the HP Original Cartridges. So after reading the reviews for the JARBO cartridges - I decided to try them. I had tried other non HP cartridges for this printer but they did not work. I must say I was pleasantly surprised when the HP Printer recognized the JARBO Cartridges and even provided the level of remaining ink for each cartridge. After going through the alignment process the cartridges are working just fine (so far). The only issue I had was when I attempted to print on HP Photo paper and the colors yellow, Blue would not mix correctly. I then performed a deep cleaning of the print heads and the issue was eliminated. As stated previously this is an older model HP printer that hopefully has a few years left in it and I have enjoyed using for a number of years. I had thought about replacing it but now that t can order the cost effective JARBO cartridge I will continue to use it as long as it works. For one set of HP Original Cartridges I can get 10 JARBO cartridges - No Contest!!! After going through the alignment process the cartridges are working just fine (so far)"

3916670,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I have to say I am alway skeptical of refurbished anything. I was REALLY skeptical of refurbished ink.

The first thing is how well it's packaged. The box is just the right size for all of the individually wrapped ink cartridges. It's a great way to store your unused cartridges.

Next is these were super easy to open. The individually wrapped packages opened easy but even better is how easy that evil orange thing on the bottom was to get off. In the official cartridges, you have to twist them and they can possibly make a mess. THESE DO NOT DO THAT. They unclip and slide off. No mess. No fight. No fuss.

Install the same way, no issues there.

Now I have two printers. The other printer is cheaper to fill. The ink output is terrible. THE INK OUTPUT ON THESE IS GREAT! As you can see in the photos the color is vibrant and wonderful.

I've also been trying to run out the first set of cartridges. It's not working. I bullet journal and I print off all my paper accessories. Sometimes that means full pages of brightly colored paper. I'm barely near the halfway mark.

So in conclusion, I will be buying this exclusively as my ink cartridges. I may see if they have some for the cheap printer too.

Excellent purchase. Absolutely Amazing Ink"

3916684,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I purchased the JARBO HP 564XL Compatible Ink Cartridges for my HP Photosmart Printer. As we all know, HP uses actual unicorn tears for printer ink which completely justifies their outrageous prices!

I was really excited to find printer ink that is not as expensive! It even comes with an extra black cartridge!!

The ink fit the printer perfectly. When I first put in the printer ink, I did receive an error that the yellow cartridge was not recognized. I took it out and reseated it and it worked fine.

HP does not like you using third party ink! I received two warnings on my printer that this was not official HP ink, and then a pop up on my computer as well!

I printed out a test page and a photo. You can see in the attached pictures that the printer ink doesnt bleed and did really great when printing a photo! I was really excited to find printer ink that is not as expensive! It even comes with an extra black cartridge!!"

3916702,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Printer ink for a long time as been a pricey inconvenience. This much ink at OfficeMax or Target would run you about $85, so when I ordered this I tried to keep my expectations low since the price was so good. However, after installing these ink cartridges and printing a few pages, the quality was as good as, if not better, than the authentic HP ink.

In fact, many of us are probably used to the standard cartridges and their lifespan, but these are the XL versions and you are getting much more ink than you would by buying the standard ink. I have been using the same cartridges for the last 6 months and I am still on my first set. The value is tremendous.

Some notes: Be careful when you are unpacking the cartridges for use. My yellow ink dripped a little bit. Fortunately it fell onto the printer and not somewhere that would cause a stain, but it something to be careful about when using. On my Photosmart printer I also got an error that said that these were not authentic ink cartridges, but after dismissing it I haven't heard anything from the printer. The ink levels do not show up on the printer, but like other reviewers have said the cartridges are translucent and you can see the levels if you want to.

No regrets about this purchase, and I am never going back! Can't Tell the Difference"
3916703,B016WI7ICQ,4,"The ink works good; however, the only tiny problem for me is that the ink gets on your hands.
Otherwise, the price is right - the stains on the fingers are MINOR!! The ink works good; however"
3916704,B016WI7ICQ,4,"The course was good , and the price was right. And for the price of 2 boxes  and it fits my printer  I like it.  And fast delivery. It works for me."

3916706,B016WI7ICQ,5,"HP Photosmart 7520

I put them in, hit OK when my printer told me that these were not HP ink cartridges, and ta-da it didn't make a bit of difference.  I am never buying HP cartridges again.  At roughly 1/3 the price, I still have the same quality print. No problems whatsoever.  In fact, the rather paranoid part of me wants to order a dang stockpile of these things, that way when I do run out of ink, I won't come back to Amazon only to find that they're no longer available and I have to cough up HP's asking price. Perfect printing at a much preferable price!"

Now I have to buy a new set and try and see what needs replacing. But I will buy HP this time. I print infrequently and my HP cartridges lasted a long ..."
3916723,B016WI7ICQ,4,"I have not used the printer much since replacing the cartriges, but so far they seem to be very good.  Much cheaper than the brand name. Great so far."
3916724,B016WI7ICQ,4,"These ink cartridges came as described. I read some reviews that mentioned messy ink but I did not experience that. I bought these for my old HP Photosmart C6350 all in one printer. I was worried it would not take these non-hp cartridges because it is so old. The funny thing is it allowed some to be installed but with the cyan and black it gave me error messages that the ink cartridges were missing or faulty. I tried power cycling, unplugging, etc. Somehow it accepted the black but really didn't like the cyan. Just before I gave up and was thinking about trying the other cyan in the package, I checked the ink cartridge area in the printer and there was a little ink left behind. I cleaned it out (actually I cleaned them all out) and popped in the cyan and bam- I get the ""non-hp cartridges installed, continue?"" Message. Now I can print again! The quality of the color increases each time I print normal stuff. When I printed a photo, it came out perfect the first time (one of the first things I printed). Will definitely purchase again after all these cartridges run out! Work great in my printer now, took some tinkering at first."
3916725,B016WI7ICQ,5,Was a little leery of using after market ink but was tired of the high cost of the manufacturers ink. So I thought I'd take a chance on JABRO. All I have to say is Wow! These work just as good as the manufacturers. I'll be a repeat customer! This is the real deal!
3916726,B016WI7ICQ,5,What a great purchase! After installing the cartridges I had to clean and align for it to work properly (nothing that shouldn't be done occasionally anyway) There have been no problems since. I saved by switching to Jarbo. :)

3916744,B016WI7ICQ,5,"At first I was a bit skeptical about the product because the first couple of ink cartridges that were in the package I got weren't working and didn't fit in my printer. The rest did work, but about 3 of them didnt. I emailed JARBO and they quickly responded and sent more ink cartridges- free of charge and free shipping. I really appreciated their quick response in addressing my issue. They have great customer service, but now that I've used the product and I still have the same ink cartridges in my printer after countless printing (more than usual when using the HP cartridges) and I still haven't replaced them...I'm convinced that this product is great! Best!"
3916745,B016WI7ICQ,5,Work great. Five Stars
3916746,B016WI7ICQ,1,"*updated review*-so bellow review still stands. I recieved an email from the company that sent these to me, they really seemed genuine in wanting to help me with the splotches on my pictures problem, however when they found the issue was with the cartridge being dye ink and not pigment ink, like it is in the original HP ink they told me that they would try to ask for a return from there boss but their return policy is strict. I told them that was fine because I was using it for a lo t of documents now and that I was going to use them anyway, I will just find another supplier the next time so I can print pictures as well. No problem....Then I recieved another email, the following(in quotes) is copied and pasted from the email ""I knew your review is rather fair and I am sorry that I can not help you more. But I really need your help. Could you kindly improve your review rating 'cause I just an ordinary staff and your review is very important for my job. Once increase one negative review that will deducted $3 from my salary. I am a a new graduate and this is my first job, so this job is very important to me.  You are a kind person and anyway I really appreciate your help and kindness."" though they had awesome customer service I am dropping this review to a one star because they asked me to lie to all of you fine people out there to help there review score. But please read my original review below and base your purchase off of that. It really does have good quality on regular paper and is an amazing price.
So this is an awesome price. The problem is that they are a little leaky. You have to get them in quick after you turn them down to install them. The black especially. The other issue is that they DO NOT print quality pictures. DO NOT buy them if you want to print pictures. I have tried everything and went through a whole set of ink because I thought there was something wrong with my setting or printer. Because they come out all splotchy! When I buy some authentic HP ink I will up date this post to let you know for sure. They print awesome on regular paper though. So by all means if you print from the Internet or documents, buy these because they look great on regular paper. DO NOT BUY FOR PICTURES! *updated to lower score*"

3916753,B016WI7ICQ,4,"This is the 1st time I have purchased non HP ink cartridges and now I will never go back to HP brand. I was skeptical at first after reading some other reviews but after taking extra caution when opening and installing the cartridges, I had no ink mess. The quality of the ink was surprisingly well also.  When you do install the cartridges, you will get a message stating that you are installing non HP brand cartridges, but you just acknowledge the message and start printing.  I will definitely purchase these again as you can't go wrong spending less than the price of one HP 564XL cartridge while receiving 12 cartridges. Great replacement ink!"

I received my ink from JARBO within two days, easily installed, and started printing right away. I love it! I can not believe I've wasted  so much money in the past purchasing HP brand. Huge price difference, highly recommend this product! Incredible Ink!"
3916757,B016WI7ICQ,1,"Installed this into my HP Deskjet 35 series printer. While the colors printed fine, the black ink did not print. It clogged the print head. After using special print head cleaners, and even disassembling the printer for a through cleaning I still had the problem. Black ink will not print. I have been using this printer problem free for 6 years until Jarbo Ink killed it. I was trying to save a few bucks and it ended up costing me much more. Use at your own risk!! Poison for your Printer"
3916758,B016WI7ICQ,5,Same quality of print as more expensive cartridges.  Glad my neighbor turned me on to JARBO.  It is my go source for ink from now on!!!! Glad my neighbor turned me on to JARBO

3916760,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Update: I have been using these cartridges for a couple of months now, and I am still completely sold on them. I have always thought the price of ink was outrageous but felt trapped. No longer! I will never but HP cartridges again.

I've always been nervous to put non-HP ink on my machines, but I tell you this is one converted customer! You will have to skip past the part where it want you to put in only HP ink but I've had that happen with HP ink that I've gotten at Staples. This stuff works just like the name brand and it's a great deal. This stuff works just like the name brand and it's a great deal"

These JARBO cartridges work great in our HP 5520 photosmart printer. I did get a ""no new cartridge was inserted"" message from our printer, but I printed a test page and it works like a charm. So thankful that I found a good replacement in these cartridges. They print nice, no streaks, no lines, print-outs; just like a HP cartridge would print. Great buy, great product"

3916772,B016WI7ICQ,4,It works well so far I got the new ink cartridges a few weeks ago. The HP printer won't able to measure the amount of ink. So I will know when the ink becomes fade as well.

3916775,B016WI7ICQ,1,I just tried to use the 564 black--i tried all cartridges I purchased in my HP 7520 printer. Every one creates an error message that the printhead is missing on the printer. I went back to HP cartridges and all is OK. A terrible product and a total rip off since I cannot return the product!! I will keep this in mind when I consider using Amazon also!!! Terrible Product

I have an HP Photosmart B210 and while it took me a while to get the printer up and running with these cartridges (I was getting a printhead error every time I tried to print). I eventually tracked it down to an incredibly dirty printhead. After a thorough cleaning, everything started working perfectly. So far, I am very happy with the purchase as the cost of ""Genuine HP Ink"" is beyond ridiculous. So far so good!"
3916780,B016WI7ICQ,4,I only have one issue. Two of the four black cartridges do not fit in my printer. Other than that the colors are great and the other 2 black cartridges work fine.

Ink is SO expensive so I figured I would look on the good ole amazon. These are perfect. They are much more affordable and with prime I got them in two days. I was able to print off the time sensitive paperwork and get it to where it was supposed to go. The cartridges fit just the way the actual HP cartridges do. They have actually lasted LONGER than the HP brand. Ink is SO expensive so I figured I would look on the good ole amazon

I have tried other refill and the color was in lines or not the right color...but these have printed perfect every time!  They also print alot of pages.  BEWARE...they can have some extra ink when you open them.  I just keep something by my printer to dab the extra ink onto. THESE ARE WORTH THEIR WEIGHT IN GOLD

I have not printed any photographs on photo paper, but who really does that anymore these days. But I have printed thousands of pages, and hundreds of big quality color pages and they are as good as the name brand cartridges. I HIGHLY recommend this product.

3916828,B016WI7ICQ,4,"Unfortunately, I couldn't get them to recognize with a printer that we have at a remote location. I made sure that they snapped in place, I removed them, tried again. Tried the second set. Nothing. I guess we'll just keep using the genuine brand.

Update: Jarbo reached out to me and provided suggestions as to how to correct the issue. First troubleshooting the printer cartridges and then ultimately offering a refund. I've bumped up my rating to reflect these changes, under the impression that a defect set made it thru and that my experience is unique in the sense that this ink works for most people, and a refund was issued. Didn't work but Jarbo offered excellent customer service."

3916842,B016WI7ICQ,5,"They work great in my printer! I did get the standard message about the cartridges not being HP cartridges as some others have mentioned.  But, that always happens when using a different brand, and they still work fine.  It was a great deal for the number of cartridges I got! Work Great!"
3916843,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I have ordered this product for a home office frequently ... about 5 or 6 times in the last year.  The ink cartridges work well for both my printers.  I had a leaky cartridge the first order, but was able to return and reorder through Amazon, which was a very quick and easy process.  The leaky cartridge was still in the sealed bag when I noticed it so no damage or mess.  I have never had any problem with any other cartridge so I will continue to order this product. It is a good value. Five Stars"
3916844,B016WI7ICQ,1,The photo quality is terrible. I bought these because of the reviews I read. If anybody thinks these provide the same quality as the HP ink cartridges they must be blind. -5 stars Minus 5 stars. Terrible photo quality. Waste of $20!
3916845,B016WI7ICQ,5,works fine...will order again Five Stars
3916846,B016WI7ICQ,5,"It's rare that I have been moved to write a review, but these print cartridges works so well given the cost, I wanted to share my experience. The cartridges came packaged in a small cardboard box with a JARBO sticker on the top. All of the cartridges were individually wrapped in clear plastic in the box. After removing the orange ink stop, all of these cartridges installed into my printer exactly as the HP original ones did. I didn't notice any of the leaking some have mentioned here. I closed my printer up, and a message popped up to say that I was using non HP cartridges. I acknowledged it and the printer started to set up the new cartridges. Even though these are non HP inks, my printer still reported the ink levels. All of my inks were now showing as full. When I finished checking that, I printed a couple of pictures to test them out. They were a bit streaky, so I cleaned my print heads and aligned the print heads. I reran my image test and everything was perfect. I probably should have ran the alignment and cleaning before printing the first time as that is usually a good idea when you change out the print cartridges, so I won't knock these for that hiccup. I did some other test printing and everything looks great. What really makes these great is the price. Considering I paid $22 for 12 cartridges and half that number of HP ink will run you somewhere in the neighborhood of $40-60 depending on where you buy it, these are a no brainer. I have only used HP inks in my printer since I bought it. I'm fairly certain that the HP tanks I just removed will be the last that I use. A great replacement for HP original cartridges at a fraction of the cost"
3916847,B016WI7ICQ,5,Arrived on time and product as described. Print quality is excellent. I have ordered once before from this vendor. Well worth the money
3916848,B016WI7ICQ,4,"I just recently installed the first three of my Jarbo cartridges and so far, so good.  I've been burned before by outside manufacturers cartridges so that's why I was cautious.  My HP printer recognized them with no problem with the usual warning that using non-HP cartridges could void my warranty but, as I said, no problems as yet and hopefully there won't be.  In checking in levels in the printer display it shows full, as opposed to those other I purchased that, when I checked, showed only half-full (brand new cartridges too).  My major test was printing out photos and comparing them with the same ones I'd printed out using original HP cartridges.  And again, they look good.  If all goes well with Jarbo I'll become a faithful customer for my replacement ink cartridge needs. Not the manufacturer original but still as good."
3916849,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Finally,ink cartridges that are affordable. They work great. Buy these! Work perfectly in my HP printer"
3916850,B016WI7ICQ,5,Don't need to buy the original. These are good ones. Good replacement at affordable price.

It has not been opened yet, we needed to print some documents right away and put one of the ""clean"" ones in - just in case.

3916860,B016WI7ICQ,5,The Jarbo toner is an excellent choice at a good price point. I needed toner for my HP multi function printer and this toner did not leave me disappointed.

Just click no and  be amazed at how well the Jarbo toner meets your need. Oh Yes!!

I was sceptical at first worried they wouldnt fit or i would have another issue but I was pleasantly surprised by how well they worked! I will definitely be using these again when I need more ink for my printer. I would recommend them to anyone! Great product! Great price!
3916864,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Worked like the originals with no mess. Got plenty of change left over to buy more. Holy Cow, what a deal! Worked like the originals with no mess"
3916865,B016WI7ICQ,5,"So far these cartridges have worked just fine in my printer, and the price was certainly much, much less than buying HP cartridges. Inexpensive and effective"
3916866,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Amazing value! Works awesome! A message is displayed that it's a non HP cartridge that's installed, but does not affect performance. Highly recommend! Amazing value, works awesome, highly recommend!"
3916867,B016WI7ICQ,1,"When I went to put the black one in, black ink poured out and got on my wedding rings. It took me forever to get them scrubbed clean. After that I went to test print and black ink was all over the paper. The black ink had leaked onto the rollers in the printer and it took me forever to get that all cleaned up. So needless to say it was a real pain. Also you might want a warning to wear gloves while installing them. I have bought other remanufactured ink in the past and have not had a problem. Ink Everywhere!! Wear gloves!!"

3916870,B016WI7ICQ,1,"JARBO color replacement ruined my printer. Although my printer called for #564 cartridges, my Hewlett Packard printer wasn't compatible, and the ink spilled through( especially black) and I had to buy a new printer. Ink printer"
3916871,B016WI7ICQ,4,The ink cartridges installed like regular HP cartridges and have worked fine so far.  I've only been using them for about a week so if I come across any issues I will update accordingly. Work great.
3916873,B016WI7ICQ,5,Great price for the quantity. So far so good. Printed both color paper prints and also pics too.  Great on all accounts. Good deal
3916874,B016WI7ICQ,5,"The JARBO replacement cartridges work great. Not only are they good quality, but the savings from the mainstream office supply stores is tremendous. Only one thing, however, is that the photo balck catridge won't fit in the slot for the HP Photosmart Plus, as it requires the size cartridge of the 564XL (double wide cartridge). Not a big deal, because the other black cartridges fit great. I would highly recommend this product...the savings is worth it. Perfect Replacements for 564XL"

3916896,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Its astounding how much genuine replacement ink for a printer costs. Ive learned it can be equally difficult to find decent knock off ink. The 5 Color Replacement for HP 564XL Ink Cartridge High Capacity (4 Black 2 Photo Black 2 Cyan 2 Magenta 2 Yellow) 12 Pack by JARBO actually held up well.

I own an HP Photosmart 7520. These cartridges worked flawlessly. I had zero issues with installation. Printing in both black and white, and color, Ive had no problems. Hopefully they will last an adequate amount of time. If they do not, I will come back and update this review.

In the meantime, these worked great for me and my printer. Its always a bonus when you don't need to eat crackers and sand for a week to afford printer ink.

Though I did purchase this at a promotional price so I could review the product, this review reflects my unbiased opinions and thoughts. They are entirely my own. I actually test out the product and write the review accordingly. It receives the rating it deserves. I hope this helps others in their purchasing decision. I also rely on Amazon reviews.

3916919,B016WI7ICQ,4,I'm never buying HP brand ever again! These worked like a charm when I needed prints for an upcoming convention. I did find that the photo black cartridge started to fail. It would print everything but the black. I swapped it out with the other cartridge and it fixed it. Printing normal documents (non photo) work just fine. I hope no other problems occur.

3916921,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These are very good quality ink cartridges, and I have had no problems with them.  The cartridge was easy to replace, and after reading other reviews I was very careful when pulling the orange tab from the cartridge.  There was no leakage, and there was no smears on printed items.  The colors are crisp and sharp.  These will be purchased again, as this is quite a good deal with such an impressive discount from genuine brand name HP ink.  This is the first time I've purchased after market ink, and there were no problems whatsoever.  I read that some had troubles with their printer not letting them print without the genuine cartridges.  I got a message on my printer that a non genuine HP cartridge was installed.  All I had to do was touch the OK icon and it immediately went into printing.  I printed several pages and they were all as good as ones I had printed with genuine cartridges.
I was given a discount for a fair review for this product.  You would be advised to get these as they will save you a lot of money over the genuine cartridges, with the quality and color just as good as the genuine.  Why spend all that money to buy brand? 5 Star ink for a fraction of the cost of genuine."

After the initial shock of ink everywhere, I grabbed 4 cartridges that didn't get inked on and proceeded to get them ready to be put inside my printer. There are certain instructions on how to do it with manufactured ink so you don't have them leak or explode everywhere.

A few of the cartridges' chips had come off or hadn't been installed onto them but it was a cinch getting them on and my printer recognized there were cartridges in there (albeit non-OEM) and let me use them. Everything works just fine and I was able to get it going.

This is an excellent price for so many ink cartridges and comes with photo black as well! I will be buying from again and again as long as they don't explode every time. Thanks.

Disclaimer: I have received this product at a freely or discounted rate in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I do not give all products 5 stars but when I do, I think they deserve them for any and all reasons I deem worthy. I am realistic when it comes to weighing the pros and cons and in the amount of stars that I give. I take some things into consideration that can be helped and leave out things that aren't the seller's fault if it comes down to it. I hope my review has been of help in letting others decide whether they would like to purchase this product.

Then test printed a written page and picture. I was amazed that I could tell no difference between the print quality of Jarbo and HP cartridges.  The reason I only gave a 4 star rating instead of 5 was due to one of the black cartridges leaked rather badly inside the protective plastic package. I will continue to buy these cartridges.

It seems all that was unnecessary.  Printed several pictures and they were perfect.  Printed several Black and White documents with embedded color images, again excellent results..

I always wondered how they made printers so cheap,  Fact is they don't they actually give away the printers and make all the money on the ink.

3916945,B016WI7ICQ,5,My wife uses the ink cartledges at her Preschool.  The amount of ink she uses was getting very expensive. So she tried yours and absolutely loves them. They work FANTASTIC FANTASTIC

Order this!
Very happy! Very happy!"
3916950,B016WI7ICQ,1,Bought these as a replacement for an HP 6520 which is listed as one of the compatible printers. For some reason the black ink works fine but once any color is involved who knows how it's going to turn out. I've reinstalled each cartridge and tried swapping out with the extra but still has the same results. Also sometimes the printer will read low ink cartridge when it's still full. Buyer beware. HP6520 owners beware

3916952,B016WI7ICQ,5,I was thrilled to find replacement ink for my printer at such a great price.  It is so expensive in the stores.  My Grandson's always like to print many things from the computer and now that I found this site they can print and print.  Thank you. Grandma on a Fixed Income

3916956,B016WI7ICQ,2,"I installed a black JARBO (HP 564XL replacement) ink cartridge.
It does not produce fine printing.
All black fonts and lines are slightly thicker, and less defined - slightly smeared.
I have ruled out the paper and the printer settings and all the other ink cartridges (that are still OEM HP) don't have this problem Ink Smears Slightly."

Had a little difficulty getting my printer to recognize the black and photo cartridges. The color ones went in and were picked up first try. I had to remove the printer head, clean it and keep trying several times. After about 45 mins, it just suddenly picked them up and started doing its thing. If you run into the same issue. I suggest cleaning the printer head then re-insert the ink and let it sit for a few minutes. Might just need time to get to the senser. Love the price!"
3916960,B016WI7ICQ,5,So far these ink cartridges work great. I have not used for photos but mostly everyday printing. I am highly satisfied. So far so good

I haven't even seen the infamous window saying ""Counterfeit cartridges detected"". Although I was a bit nervous about ordering these at first, I figured 'why not?', since a full set of HP cartridges costs an outrageous $60. These fully deserve 5 stars!

3916977,B016WI7ICQ,4,"Seems to work just fine with my HP printer.  Two complete sets of ink for about what it would cost to buy two HP ink cartridges, so definitely a good deal there.  I just use my printer for normal home use.  Don't know how these would be if printing photos or anything high resolution, but work just fine for everyday use.  Didn't have any issues with ink leaking or anything like that.  Plugged right into my printer.  The printer did say I wasn't using HP ink and couldn't guarantee quality, but just hit ""OK"" and everything works fine. Seems to work just fine with my HP printer"

3916983,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I took a chance on these cartridges fully expecting to lose my investment. I now have one of each installed in my printer and it is working just fine. Yes, as another comment indicated, HP notes that it is not a genuine HP product. But if you just continue, they seem to work fine. Not sure how long they will last, although they all claim to be ""XL."" But the savings are quite large, so as of now, I would say take the chance! Big Savings! Worth the risk!"

3917020,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These ink cartridges are the only ones, other than actual HP ink, that worked in my printer. This printer is very picky with different brands of inks, and Jarbo by far, hands down has been the only one that I can actually use! On top of that, I don't see any difference in vibrancy, or how long the ink cartridges last. It's like using actual HP inks, but at a fraction of the cost! Extremely satisfied with these ink cartridges, and will be purchasing more in the future! Great Ink for HP Printer!!"

3917025,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I've been making a photo album for my friend, and of course, have used a ton of ink during the process.  Previously, I had only used brand-name cartridges in my printer, but I cringed at the price, when I went to buy 2 more sets of cartridges, knowing I had a lot more pictures to print.  So, I decided to give these cartridges a try, and I am so glad that I did!  I have an HP Photosmart 7510 printer, and these work beautifully.  The pictures came out looking just as good as they did when I used brand-name cartridges, and they cost a fraction of the price.  I will be buying these again, for sure (as long as their prices stay so good!); there's no reason to go back to brand name! No difference in photo printing quality, vs. brand name! Excellent price for a great product!"

Buying Jarbo cartridge's save me at least 75% over the HP cartridge's.  HP prices cost as much as their printer that come with the ink cartridges

I wish Jarbo would sell individual color cartridges as the photo blk always get used up 1st and you end up with more of the regular blk cartridges in your inventory. Rhino13"

3917076,B016WI7ICQ,4,"It works and is a low cost alternative for HP ink cartridges. I find that the black ink is slightly less black than HP Ink. It's more of a very dark grey. Other colors come out bright and even but just a tad less vibrant than HP ink. I would say if you have high standards for color exactness (especially black) in a professional presentation you should pony up the cost for HP ink. For everyday printing where colors don't need to be absolutely perfect and it's OK that blacks come out a very dark grey, this is a great low cost alternative. I'm not saying that these inks make bad looking documents per se, They look good and are very readable. It's just that when compared directly to HP Ink I find the HP ink comes out just a bit better, blacks a bit blacker, colors a bit more vibrant. All in all I'd go with HP inks for professional level presentation, Jarbo ink for routine day to day printing. Less cost, almost as good as HP"

She can now print to her hearts content with out worrying about wasting too much color ink in her printouts.

3917131,B016WI7ICQ,5,They are better than expected. Thankyou Five Stars
3917132,B016WI7ICQ,5,I was pleased with the number of cartridges I received for this amazing price.  Easy to open and install.  The ink quality is no different than the more expensive HP cartridges I have been purchasing for several years.  Will always use these from now on. Great product
3917133,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I was skeptical of buying non OEM replacement ink cartridges for my HP printer. My concerns were regarding the quality of the ink and compatibility with the printer.  Whenever you replace a cartridge the printer confirms it is an HP ink cartridge.  The ink did not squirt out of the cartridge when I removed the protective cap, unlike other brands I have read about. This was a relief as I didn't have ink all over me. I replaced all 5 cartridges in the printer without even one problem. Of course my printer informed me they weren't HP replacements. I just pressed OK and continued with the setup. The printer functioned perfectly with the Jarbo replacements.  This was a great purchase and the price just can't be beat.  I won't be buying the HP replacements ever again. Terrific ink replacement cartridges!!!"
3917134,B016WI7ICQ,5,Very inexpensive and works great! I love that you can see the ink! Will buy here again! Awesome product!
3917135,B016WI7ICQ,5,I always bought hp ink cartridges for my printer but I bought these for the first time and immediately loaded the black and so far so good. No problem. The printer recognized they were not an hP product but still accepted them. No is d use to report. Very pleased to save some money. Work just fine
3917136,B016WI7ICQ,2,"The first cartridge I used was not recognized by my printer. The second (of the same color) had no label on it?? and was covered in ink, which got all over my fingers. It did, however, work once I got it cleaned up. Interestingly, a few days after my purchase, I received a very nice email asking if I was happy with my purchase. I explained the problem, but never heard back from them again -  even after I let them know I was planning to give them a poor review. It's almost more frustrating when a company pretends to care about your opinion, but then does nothing when you express some level of dissatisfaction.  We'll see if they respond to this review. Not a great first impression"

3917143,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I was tired of paying crazy money for replacement cartridges for my HP printer and while I was looking up new cartridges I saw these for practically half the price of HP cartridges so I gave them a try being skeptical about off brand cartridges having used them for other printers. Inserted the new cartridges and of course the printer had something to say about that to the effect of ""printer cannot guarantee quality printing using non Hp ink"" something like that. Anyways I have no complaints about the quality. They work fine in the printer and I will be buying this product from now on. Excellent product. Excellent replacement for HP ink."

3917160,B016WI7ICQ,5,"10.13.2016
Update- I mainly use this printer for color prints and need to reorder even though I still have plenty of black ink left. In my opinion they last even longer than the HP cartridges and I love the simple fact that they use clear plastic so you can actually see the ink level. (Brilliant Idea)

I have a HP Photosmart 6520. I usually purchase HP cartridges, although usually find them for better deals on Amazon. However these were new and based upon the already good ratings and the great price...I thought I'd give them a try.

I have been using them for a few weeks now and they worked just as good as HP cartridges. Print quality and color are very good and I can't speak as to how long they will last, but am completely happy with my purchase so far.

It's great to be able to save money and all because of a beautiful word...Capitalism... Save your money and purchase these for your printer.

12.15.2016 UPDATE
Again, these cartridges are great. Perfect color and last a long time. The only negative that I have is for my HP Photosmart 6520. The Photo Black cartridges do not fit my printer. They are thinner (like the color cartridges and only the regular blank ink cartridge fits. Amazing Cartridges"
3917161,B016WI7ICQ,4,"I still think these are excellent cartridges, but was disappointed to find that two of them didn't work. I don't know what the problem was, but they just wouldn't work, so they had to be tossed. However, considering I've used almost all of them, I'd still say they're worth the price.

3917203,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I purchased these for my HP Photosmart 7515.  So far, no complaints at all.  The only annoying thing is the printer reminding you that you didn't use genuine HP ink, but I'll take that for the price.  I've only printed documents with mixed text and a little color and some grayscale pictures.  The ink works great so far, and the swap was as easy as using regular HP ink, just so much cheaper.  Like another reviewer said, I'll never go back.  The only thing I'd say to the many low reviews I've seen is to make sure your current printer uses 564 ink, and you won't have any problems. Good ink for a great price"
3917204,B016WI7ICQ,5,Best non OEM printer cartridges I've ever bought.  Price was almost too good to be true until I got the cartridges and have been using them...a lot.  Really good deal!  Highly recommend. Best non OEM printer cartridges Ever!

3917214,B016WI7ICQ,4,"My only gripe about these cartridges is that upon arrival 2 of the black cartridges leaked. One was ok, it just leaked a little inside of its own package, but the other leaked beyond its package and made a mess of my hands (and it doesn't easily come off). I've switched out all the cartridges in my printer to these and so far have printed about 10 pages (with pictures) and they are working great. I would recommend since they are a great value, just be careful when you open the package. Work Great. Open carefully."
3917215,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I am very happy with purchase so far. I know the quality of print is not hp but, for the prize of these inks, it matters not. We mostly print classroom related documents. Where have you been all my life?"

3917240,B016WI7ICQ,5,"There's no difference in quality from HP brand that I can tell.  I think it might actually hold more ink than the HP brand. As good as brand name suppliers, maybe even better"
3917241,B016WI7ICQ,5,I bought ink cartridges for my HP printer. They fit well. Fast service. They are working good so far but I'm not a frequent printer. I will update at a later date. Ink Cartridges !!
3917242,B016WI7ICQ,4,"So far, these replacement cartridges are working as the HP originals.  The only negative is the HP printer reports that the cartridge replacement is not under HP warranty.  I say... Tough, if it works use it...

3917260,B016WI7ICQ,4,"Fit perfectly in my HP Photosmart 6510. Printing beautifully. The product I received for the price was great. ONLY problem and the only reason this is four rather than five stars was that the red cartridge leaked in the package but was contained in the cellophane wrapper, so the mess wasn't all over the other cartridges. Great Value!!! In the pics below the red cartridge alone and the multiple cartridges you see are just half the order I received! The rest are in my printer. Don't be afraid to order these!!

When installing all I had to do was click okay when my printer said that these are not genuine HP cartridges. From there I cleaned the print heads and aligned the printer, and haven't had any problems. I will never go back to overpaying for HP brand ink. Great value"

3917279,B016WI7ICQ,1,"These ink cartridges work ok when printing on regular paper. However when printing on photo paper, photos come out mostly magenta and distorted. I tried aligning my printer and cleaning the nozzles twice and still no good. As I primarily wanted to use my printer for photos this is most unsatisfactory and I regret having purchased them in bulk. I will not be buying these cartridges again and will buy genuine hp ink from now on. Bad ink for photos"

The only thing weird, is my printer started restarting with error codes after using these. So I don't know if they could ruin a printer software, or if it's just my printer.... Ink wise they are great Ink is great, software is questionable"

3917334,B016WI7ICQ,5,Non HP replacement ink cartridges are hit and miss.  Based on my past experience I expect about half of the cartridges to actually work.

3917338,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I must be completely honest that I have NEVER purchased ink that was not the genuine brand that is recommended by the manufacturer. In my case that is HP ink. I have to tell you that as a teacher, I run through ink like people drink water and the amount of money that I was spending was insane. After A LOT of research I decided to try these ink cartridges and boy am I glad that I did. These ink cartridges are definitely worth the money and I know that I will not be buying genuine HP again and will continue to order these as needed. The only negative that I have found with these is that my printer will not read the ink levels, but I can easily see when the ink is getting low because the cartridges are see through and you can tell when the printing quality starts to diminish. I highly recommend trying these cartridges because I know I will continue to buy these from now on. Awesome value"

3917362,B016WI7ICQ,5,These worked perfect in HP 7520 printer. It gave me a warning that they were not HP cartridges twice but that was it. It even correctly shows the ink levels as full.

Great reviews are totally correct for this product.
3917363,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Works great and perfectly with both printers I own. The only negative was that one of the cartridges leaked in the packaging and got onto another one of the cartridge. But that still left me with 8 cartridges at this price versus one more expensive one from HP. Prints pictures and paper identically to HP. Plus there is a ton of ink in these and you can see the level.

Update: The JARBO team contacted me a few days after ordering and I notified them of the damaged package and within two days they had sent me a whole new set of ink plus two additional black cartridges to replace the one that was damaged. Their service was very friendly and fast. I would highly recommend buying this product. Great product and service. Great deal at the price!"

3917387,B016WI7ICQ,4,The only reason I'm not giving this ink a 5 star is because the color cartridges are difficult to install.  I was on the verge of giving them away in hopes that they would fit in my sister's printer.  For some reason I tried one last time and was amazed they clicked in.  Pages print just as clearly as with HP ink.  A little difficult to install but great ink for a GREAT price!  Guess the key is to not give up on installation. Happy with JARBO ink.

For several years now, I have been refilling HP Cartridges with third party ink. It wasn't until recently that I had to buy refills for the ink, and decided that it was worth a few extra dollars to buy prefilled third party cartridges instead. I read many mixed reviews, but must say that these cartridges are very simple to use, and can even be recapped for storage so that they do not leak or dry out! The colors print out just like original ink, and the extra black cartridges are worth every penny. I absolutely will be buying these again for my father to use after I move out.

3917467,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I'm so pleased with this cartridge pack!  I just installed 3 new Jarbo color ink cartridges, as my printer still has a nearly full HP branded black cartridge I was ""forced"" to purchase locally.  I paid half the price for (1) single, standard ( not extra large) HP black ink cartridge,as I did for this ENTIRE cartridge pack ( I'd call it a Super-pack).

I received the package in perfect condition via UPS 2nd day air.  The shipping packaging was more than adequate to avoid damage. The product packaging was aesthetically pleasing, with the JARBO crisp, clean, lime green logo printed beautifully on a perfectly sized brown box of good quality.

I opened my 3 colors ( each individually packaged ), popped the protective orange plastic thumb-tab off from the ink pad & installed each cartridge with no troubles at all.  I ran the clean cartridge head tool as well as the cartridge align tool and finally a print quality test sheet; EVERYTHING IS PERFECT!  The last thing I'll mention that is SUPER AWESOME;  the cartridges are CLEAR, SERIOUSLY  Yay, brilliant!

Thank you so much JARBO for providing a quality product at a fair price.  We go through ink fast here at home; I know where I'll be purchasing from now on.

I'm using a 4-year old HP All in one B210a.
I was not paid or compensated in any way for my review.  I wrote a raving review because I WANTED to!  The actual copies are much more vibrant than the photos may appear Two thumbs up, three if you have them! Ecstatic"

3917513,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I was a little leery about these when ordering, but I saw other good reviews and decided to give them a shot. Ink cartridges normally are pretty expensive!

For the price and the quality-you cant go wrong.  I will be a customer for ever! Also, they are lasting much longer than the Hp. The only thing that happens is the printer doesn't tell you when your printer is low on ink but for the quality and the savings who cares-I think I can figure out when my ink is out when there's no printing with the page. There are even better than Hp ink cartridges!"

When printing large volumes, In the print que, I found that selecting draft print does not do well with these inks. The printed item may come out smudged or blurry.  I am working on a dissertation and my proposal is 132 pages in length thus far.  I wanted to print my final document and I found that ""draft"" printing selection had too many words that were blurred.  I switched to ""normal"" printing, and 98% of the words were fine, and when I switched to ""best"" printing, there were no blurs.  So what does this all mean?  It means if you are printing a very lengthy document, you will need to either use ""normal"" print or ""best"" print in the advance printing selection and therefore you will end up using more ink.  Whereas the normal HP ink cartridges if you select draft printing, it has no problems.  :)  Happy Printing.  I will purchase again. Great item for the price.... :)"

3917530,B016WI7ICQ,2,"Unfortunately even tho it says they are compatible with my printer these did not work for me. The only one that will stay in without popping out is the black so every time I tried to print I would have to re-open the top push these down and then let the printing start, but half way through it they would pop back up and my printer would send out an error message. I really wanted them to work but my HP Photosmart Plus doesn't like them. For the price it was worth a shot because they are much more affordable then HP brand refills, but this was a gamble that didn't pay off for me :( Too Bad...so Sad :("

3917552,B016WI7ICQ,5,The cartridges work great with my HP  Photosmart 520;  you have to kinda wiggle them in till you hear them snap though. Also you won't be able to detect the levels  The photo  and document print quality is excellent. The cartridges work great with my HP Photosmart 520
3917553,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Works awesome on my HP printer. Have always bought HP ink cartridges and I will not buy HP ink any more. These work just as well as the HP ink. And they are way cheaper.

3917572,B016WI7ICQ,5,A very good product at a very reasonable price Four Stars
3917573,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Just installed these printer cartridges into my HP Photosmart 7520 Series AIO printer. At first I was apprehensive whether these would work. This is because HP installs chips into their proprietary ink cartridges so that only their cartridges are seen as ""official"" within the printers' OS.

What I discovered is that once these JARBO ink cartridges were installed, I ran a print quality test and it worked flawlessly! Although the printer did recognize that the cartridges were not official HP cartridges. It worked regardless of the warning message.

HP has gotten away with selling overpriced, proprietary ink for far, far too long. You can see with their ""chips"" that their intentions were to try and lock their customer's even further into buying ONLY THEIR PROPRIETARY, OVERPRICED INK. We are talking of prices around $80 or more for ink! Compared to the price of these JARBO, it's a no brainer-- especially when you get 2 color refills all for $29.

HP is truly a scummy company. No brainer for the price! These work just as well as HP's highly overpriced, proprietary ink."
3917574,B016WI7ICQ,5,Very happy with my purchase. Good value and nice quality.
3917575,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Great price, great product they work as they should Five Stars"
3917576,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Great ink for coming from a company I have never heard of before searching on Amazon.com. Highly recommend this product to others as they could stand to gain alot from not overpaying for ink by utilizing JARBO ink instead of HP ink cartridges. Much more affordable in comparison to HP ink, and lasts quite a while as far as I can tell, as I am still on my first four cartridges of the twelve pack High capacity ink cartridges I purchased! Awesome!!!"

The installation was a snap and the print quality is at least as good as the HP cartridges"
3917598,B016WI7ICQ,5,"This ink works great with my printer! I was skeptical at first, because it is very inexpensive and I have always gone with the ink that was the same brand as my printer. One of the things that happened to me in the past was the ink would get messy and smear with off brand cartridges. This one does not. I was surprised to find that it uses up all the ink how long it lasts! I do lots of printing for Boy Scouts and I now know that this is the way to go. I have been telling everyone about it. Quality Inexpensive Ink!"

3917613,B016WI7ICQ,5,"This set is a fantastic break in cost for cartridges for my printer! First, these come individually wrapped and are clear so you can see exactly how much ink is left inside. Why don't all cartridges come this way? These are a perfect fit in my HP printer. I purchased the 2 set + 2 black pack, and judging by how much i have printed so far, these will last quite a while. I have a printer in my office, but use this set at my home and print labels, reports, tags for selling items at my local fair sale, menus, cards.... school projects. The coloring is clean and clear. It isn't smudgy or grainy. Very pleased! I received a discount to test and provide a genuine review from my personal use and experience.

3917621,B016WI7ICQ,4,"I was so happy to discover ink cartridges for my printer that I didn't have to pay an arm and a leg for! My only problem, which is completely my own fault, is that I didn't know my printer doesn't have a photo ink cartridge and now I have two photo ink cartridges that I have no use for. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and I will buy again, hopefully there are some that I can order without photo ink. Great buy!"
3917622,B016WI7ICQ,1,"I wish I had good news. Unfortunately, they don't work. They printed about 4 pages, then the black stopped printing at all. Since then, I have tried everything. I'm very tech saavy and did everything from aligning the cartridges to cleaning the heads and everything in between. I've been on many HP sites and tried all of the suggested fixes, shy of creating a stuffed voodoo HP printer and sacrificing a chicken. The printer is/was in perfect condition and printed perfectly before I tried aftermarket ink. I blame the ink. It's out of warranty now so I'm stuck. I wish I had better news. You get what you pay for. Wish I just spent the money on HP ink."

I was informed to remove the wrapping before removing the orange plastic strip on the end so it would not be messy.  I did that.  I have had no problems.  The printer will state that they are non HP products but they still work. Works Fine.
3917654,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I was a little reluctant to by cartridges that were not made by HP but I am so glad I did. They are working just as well as Hp's at a fraction of the cost. Another plus is the cartridge is clear so you can see how much ink is left. You don't really need that because the chip on the cartridge tells you the amount, but I like that I can see the amount. Just as good as HP but at a fraction of the cost."

3917674,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect, but I can't see any difference at all from the HP ink.  Crisp clear copies.  You've made it so much more affordable and I won't have to be as conservative with what I print.  No more ""Printer Grinch!""  Thank you! No more ""Printer Grinch!"""
3917675,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Works in my printer after the usual noncompatibility notice. I promptly printed a 149 page manual upon installation and experienced great prints with clarity, great color. Valuable bargain. Will continue to use Jarbo as my go to source for my printing needs. Great Deal!!"
3917676,B016WI7ICQ,5,"These ink cartridges work perfectly. No mess. No spills. No price gouging. I'm extremely satisfied and I quite honestly feel a little foolish for having paid full price for ""name brand"" ink all this time. Highly recommended. Works perfectly with no mess"

3917682,B016WI7ICQ,5,Ink cartridges are well designed and work perfectly in my printer. Great ink cartridges
3917683,B016WI7ICQ,2,"The ink was delivered today.  When I received it one of the magentas had sprung a leak. I was able to wipe it off and install it but it was messy.

Two of the black cartridges had the contact points off the cartridge.  I was able to get one back in place while still in the package but the other one the contact point chip was out of its holder.

I ran cleaning and alignment on the printer and it seems to be printing ok.

I don't think I will be buying ink from these folks again. The ink was delivered today. When I received it ..."
3917684,B016WI7ICQ,1,Penny wise pound foolish with this product.  Cheaply made and do not fit correctly so the printer won't work.  Tried to save a few bucks but going to have to buy HP cartridges any way.  Penny wise..... Penny wise pound foolish with this product. Cheaply made ...
3917685,B016WI7ICQ,5,Works fine once one figures out how to navigate around HP's warning that the sky will fall should one use these... Works fine once one figures out how to navigate around HP's ...
3917686,B016WI7ICQ,1,Really disappointed with this product.  Have replaced the black in cartridge twice and the black ink is so light when it prints it's barely visible.  Not usable.  Will not buy again. Really disappointed with this product
3917687,B016WI7ICQ,5,This is my second review after purchasing and using this product for a long period of time. The cartridges have worked well and the customer service is outstanding. I will certainly order from this seller again! Recently purchased this product and so far I am satisfied. Initially
3917688,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Works the same as name brand. One of the black ink cartridges was broken, however, I still received 2 packs of colored ink and 5 black cartridges for less than a name brand single pack. Pretty cool. If I had let customer service know one was broken, I'm sure they would have replaced it, as they've been very friendly and emailed me after my purchase to make sure everything was okay. I just didn't bother. Pretty cool. If I had let customer service know ..."

3917692,B016WI7ICQ,1,"I replaced the yellow ink a few days ago and at the beginning it printed fine. The cartridge still has plenty of ink but would not print the yellow. I cleaned the nozzles, took it out and put it back it twice -  tried everything I could - does not work ... very very frustrated, I want my money back ... few days ago and at the beginning it printed fine. The cartridge still has plenty of ink but ..."
3917694,B016WI7ICQ,5,great Five Stars
3917695,B016WI7ICQ,2,My printer was listed but the black cartridges would not fit the printer.  Disappointed because the color cartridges are great. Love that you can physically see how much ink is in the cartridge. Disappointed. Black cartridges won't work.
3917696,B016WI7ICQ,5,I will buy these cartridges from now on. Five Stars
3917697,B016WI7ICQ,4,"The cartridges are working but they do not clip into my printer very tightly which allows them to wiggle lose, and when this happens my printer does not recognize a cartridge in anymore. Great price, they are working, but not perfect.  Thank. Great price, they are working"
3917698,B016WI7ICQ,5,Very inexpensive and work great! Works great!
3917699,B016WI7ICQ,5,Quality seems just fine!  I will be printing a lot more knowing that I won't have to give my first born child to pay for ink.  The install was clean and easy. Quality seems just fine! I will be printing a lot more knowing ...
3917700,B016WI7ICQ,1,These do not fit in my HP Photosmart 6520 printer. One Star
3917701,B016WI7ICQ,4,"I saw this and wanted to try and save some money as HP cartridges are outrageously over-priced. I read the reviews for several other
Non-OEM ink cartridge makers, and this had the highest rating out of all of them, with the lowest amount of 1 stars. I received the package promptly, and as stated. My first replacement was a magenta. I removed the orange protector/ barrier over the ink depositor sponge, flipped it to insert it in the slot, and received a drop of free flowing ink on my fingers. I had hoped this wouldn't happen, but was prepared after having read the other reviews. (You'll notice I gave it four stars. Everything lines up with a great product for the price. The drop of ink was the lost star). My solution to the problem? I flipped the cartridge back over, took a tissue and soaked up the ink in the sponge, and quickly flipped it over and inserted it in the cartridge slot. Problem solved. I went down the line that way with all the inks being replaced. I am assuming it will drain all the ink before needing replacing, otherwise, I may have a mess. So far so good though. Lots of ink. Small price and a small hassle to save the money I am saving. Good product, and it prints great. Everything lines up with a great product for the price"
3917702,B016WI7ICQ,5,These ink cartridges work as good as the HP cartridges at a better price. I even also got more! Worth a try!
3917703,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Cartridges are easier to install than the HP originals.  After nearly a week, the cartridges continue to work just fine! The cartridges continue to work just fine!"
3917704,B016WI7ICQ,5,"Thank you, works great! works great!"
3917706,B016WI7ICQ,5,Worked Perfectly Five Stars
3917707,B016WI7ICQ,5,Your 564 ink cartridges worked perfect in my HP Photosmart 752 copier!  I have 3 teenagers and our copier is used several times each day.  The cartridges went in easy and the price is reasonable. I will definitely continue ordering JARBO ink cartridges! These ink cartridges are great!!!
3917708,B016WI7ICQ,5,Great cartridges. They print good Five Stars
3917709,B016WI7ICQ,5,Great product - great value for the money - ships fast! works as good if not better than the HP INK! Five Stars
5423009,B016WI7ICQ,5,Have had no problems with this product.  Works as described.  I do not see any difference in HP brand.  Value cannot be beat. Great product replacement.
5423010,B016WI7ICQ,5,Inexpensive and works great! This is our second order. Works great on HP printers!
5423011,B016WI7ICQ,5,So far so good. Fitted correctly. Print was correct color. No leaks. Its great! What a DEAL!
5423012,B016WI7ICQ,5,"So far, so good.  Cartridges were easy to install, test page printed very well.

Much cheaper than HP alternative. so good. Cartridges were easy to install"
5423013,B016WI7ICQ,5,Love the price and the fact that it fits Compatible & economical
5423014,B016WI7ICQ,5,"I was able to open (without dripping as others have said) and install without any issues. Also printed a test page. That's as far as I have gone so far, but no issues. Installs fine"
5423015,B016WI7ICQ,5,This ink work very well in all my hp printers. Its nice to have an option that works just as well as the OE cartridge at a much lower price. Great ink great price
5423016,B016WI7ICQ,1,"After reading so many positive reviews, I decided against my better judgement to purchase these cartridges instead of buying the authentic HP replacement cartridges for my HP Photosmart 7515 printer.  While the black ink seemed to work fine, the color inks were horrible.  I tried printing multiple pictures with different backgrounds and subjects, and they all came out completed saturated in a pink hue while all the other colors were washed out.  The cartridges are basically unusable.  I've learned my lesson and will stick to genuine HP cartridges from now on.... Disappointed"
5423017,B016WI7ICQ,5,The ink cartridges came as promised and in good condition.  They are easy to use and seem to last as long as the HP cartridges and cost much less.  I would recommend them. The price is great and they work great!
5423018,B016WI7ICQ,5,Easy to order.  Works well with my printer Works like the expensive inks
