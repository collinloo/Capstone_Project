3921486,B016XTRBIU,5,great prices and great ink! would buy again! Five Stars
3921487,B016XTRBIU,5,"Let me start off by saying I have never purchased ink that wasn't from the manufacturer. Ive heard stories that the print quality isn't good at all. When I have to replace all my cartridges I always get the 920xl. The ""XL"" is much more ink than the standard 920 cartridge. I usually buy from Amazon and I buy the black, yellow, cyan, and magenta and always pay at least $80.

I received these today and was exited to find out what the quality would be. I wasn't very hopeful, but the price wasn't too bad if it was a total loss. They come very nicely packaged just like the HP cartridges. You have to remove the air hole cover and there is a cap over the spot where the ink flows out. They were the exact same size, the only difference was that they were clear and I could see the ink (this is a plus that I will talk about later). They snapped in perfect.

Before using them I pulled them back out and installed my almost empty Hp cartridges to print a few test pages. Then I put the Miroo cartridges in and printed the same test pages. My first pages were pretty poor. I figured the rumors I heard was right. I decided to use the print head cleaner function on my printer to see if that would help. After cleaning I ran the test again. The results were pretty surprising. The test pages are pretty identical. My wife said she thought the darker colors looked better on the Miroo test, but I thought they looked the same. Either way I was impressed in the quality and that I had spent an eighth of the price.

If you have inconsistent printing like I did try to clean the print heads. I could access mine in setting on the printer itself or through the software on my PC. I have also taken pictures of the test pages for you to judge for yourself.

Overall I am very pleased with this product. It does what it says it will do and is a great price. I received this product at a discount to review. This in no way reflects the review I gave. I gave an honest, unbiased review. Save tons of money over name brand, but get the same quality"
3921488,B016XTRBIU,5,"For the price, these are great. We do simple at-home printing of documents and stuff the kids like to print. These definitely get the job done for the price. Thanks! Gets the job done!"
3921489,B016XTRBIU,4,"They came fast. When you peel off the tape protection, you can see that the opening is soaked with ink, best is tap it to a napkin to wipe out the excess, and then plug in the printer, otherwise would be pretty mess.
So far printed a couple of papers in a week, and no problem.

update 3/17/2016
It is a little annoying the message that pop out saying that the ink is not compatible with HP, because you think that it is already printed and actually the system is in  hold waiting for response from the pop out screen.
Also the color yellow is not working, some time print and some time not. It is ok with basic work and NOT OK with important work.
update on 10/20/2016
Miroo customer service rep. contacted me saying that will send me another package for me to try and hoping for a better review. I gave in. The clipping of the cartridge to the cart is a little better so I don't need to tape it to the cart to keep it inside (otherwise would be slightly loose and the printer would not detect the cartridge and would give me a message of missing cartridge. But on the other hand I spent quite time to make the cartridge be recognized. The HP printer would give me message of defective cartridge randomly between the 4 of them, even to one that was legitimate HP. After start over and change the cartridges one at a time, I was able to get all of them recognized, and the printing is working since without any problem. I would upgrade the review to 4 starts. You cannot beat the price $10 for 4 cartridge ! you just need to have a little patience to answer the printer question of not OEM cartridge etc. best is tap it to a napkin to wipe out ..."
3921490,B016XTRBIU,2,I ordered the set of 4 cartridges and only the black was accepted by my printer.  It's the first time I have purchased any brand other than HP for my printer. In the future I will only order HP ink. Didn't work in my printer.

3921495,B016XTRBIU,4,"So far I only installed the black cartridge. I get an annoying start up message from my HP printer, that a non HP cartridge is installed.
It prints just like an original OEM product. I get an annoying start up message from my HP printer"
3921496,B016XTRBIU,1,"The black cartridge leaked and now it only prints a smudged unusable copy after 2 pages have already printed. The first 2 are light followed by subsequent smudged pages. My little printer was awesome before I bought and installed this product.  The colored cartridges seemed to be fine, but it doesn't matter since the black is needed and printer is ruined. So many regrets. No no no"

Working great.  Seems to have a little problem with the color ""yellow"".  Makes it too dark.

Aug. 15, 2018  Unable to print envelopes or address labels.  Replaced with HP ink, prints labels and envelopes well.  What gives?  Am I doing something wrong? Working great so far!"

3921505,B016XTRBIU,5,"Received and installed today 8/12/2018. Printer had a difficult time recogning the cartridges, but a power cycle seemed to do the trick. No messy ink when I installed. No splotches on the page.  Printed a test page and all looks good. Will post an update if anything changes, but I am excited about this cheaper solution.
Update: printed about 10 pages without issue.  Mix of photos and clipart. Looks just as good as HP ink. So far so good"
3921506,B016XTRBIU,5,Received on time and as described. No complaints!
3921508,B016XTRBIU,1,Killed my perfectly good HP printer. Tried to save a couple bucks and ended costing me a printer. Not recommended! Killed my HP printer.
3921509,B016XTRBIU,5,100% functional at low price Excelent
3921510,B016XTRBIU,2,Some of the colors worked but everything that was supposed to be printed in gray came out yellow.  I had to throw them away and go and buy the regular expensive ones instead. Colors off

3921513,B016XTRBIU,5,Color rendering is excellent. The prices for the ink cartridges cant be beat! Im 100% satisfied. Theres no difference in the quality of this ink compared to HP ink.
3921514,B016XTRBIU,5,"I used to buy an HP brand of cartridges all the time, wasted money - until I found MIROO replacements. Came in a very nice package, and they were easy to install but whats best is that I have not noticed any change in printing - the quality and colors are great and for a fraction of the cost of HP cartridges! Very happy with my purchase and will buy again. Thank you! No need to buy HP brand anymore!"
3921515,B016XTRBIU,5,"Shake the cartridges well before installing.  Open with gloves on inside a bag just incase they splatter.  The black one did a little.  Colors look fine when printing.  Installed them almost 2 months ago and continue to function as they should.  I cleaned the printhead before installing since it had been a long time since using the printer.  Great deal for the price, was happy that they worked out, at that price, really had nothing to lose. No problems as of yet."
3921516,B016XTRBIU,5,I liked the quality and the price very much. Quality is just as good as the ones you buy in the store for 3 times as much money.
3921517,B016XTRBIU,4,Used on HP printer and they work just fine for every day use. Good substitute for expensive HP cartriges
3921518,B016XTRBIU,4,"I ordered several ink cartridges from this seller, and one of the black cartridges did not work correctly.  Most of the printout was smudged.  I contacted the seller, and after they had me first try to clean the print head, they quickly sent me a replacement.  So while I was not happy initially when it didn't work, I was satisfied at how quickly they sent a replacement that works fine. Replacement sent quickly for defective black cartridge"

3921547,B016XTRBIU,5,"Within 6 months, these dried up and would no longer print.  They are sponge based, so the usual methods of freeing up the dried ink with warm water will not work.  You have to use a syringe to inject 3 ml of water into the chamber.  The great news is: the seller agreed to refund my purchase. Dry Up Quicker Than A Sponge in Death Valley"
3921548,B016XTRBIU,5,"Amazed to find these really work and work well!  I did have a little trouble with the cyan, but after wiping with alcohol as recommended it worked fine. Amazed to find these really work and work well"

3921568,B016XTRBIU,1,"Ive had luck with this brand before, however this batch doesnt work. First, they sent two cyans and no magenta. Second, prior to putting these ink cartridges into my printer, I was able to print (albeit somewhat faint). With the new cartridges, I only get ink cartridges are empty error message. Cant print. Try other vendor."

3921570,B016XTRBIU,5,"Received MIROO Replacement for HP 920 XL Ink Cartridge set of all colors+black. Set them upside down for three hours prior to install. Installed them carefully, clearing out the ""non-genuine"" message that popped up on the printer afterwards.

Have since printed 50+ pages, all seem identical in quality to OEM HP ink, at about  the price.

No mess or exploding ink or whatever I read from some of the lower rated reviews. (I'm not stating that those instances can't happen but it wasn't my experience.)

At the present moment I'm very satisfied. I'd say for $11 this is a great value, especially considering that the full set of HP genuine carts is almost $100 for the XL size. I've also read that the cost of production of most ink carts is around $0.50, even for HP, so I'm not feeling too sorry for HP losing my business to what I clearly believe is a adequate and cost effective replacement. ) At the present moment I'm very satisfied. I'd say for $11 this is a great ..."

3921585,B016XTRBIU,2,"I tried this because it was such a deal. So much of a deal, in fact, that when I put it in my printer, the printer says that the cartridges are damaged, or refuses to recognize them, and will not print. I wish I hadn't waited so long to try them out, or I would return them since I can't use them, and now that my HP ink is depleted, I am stuck with these lemons. LEMONS"

3921634,B016XTRBIU,5,"Not OEM hp cartridges but still good. I haven't printed much on these since they are for my secondary printer, but what i have done has been good. No issues with bleadover or streaking that I've seen. The one down side I have seen so far is that the printer complains that it's a non hp cartridge which is ok with me and actually not a surprise. Good set, works well and has the standard non-hp error message."
3921635,B016XTRBIU,5,"I just installed the ink cartridges last week and love how they fit perfectly into my HP printer. The only issue I had was getting ink on my fingers and hands while inserting them, and that was most likely my trying to hurry. I was almost out the door to work when I decided to do this.

3921652,B016XTRBIU,5,"When first installed the printer states that the cartridge is defective or broken.  When looking at the troubleshooting page... it suggests turning off the printer and restarting it.... WORKS  !  Prints like a charm, for the price it really lasts long too.... Prints like a charm"
3921653,B016XTRBIU,4,"I'm writing this first, even though it is the last update, 8/14/2018.  The seller sent me a complete set of replacement cartridges.  The cartridges appear the same as the first MIROO cartridges and also appear the same as a competitors generic cartridges.  I believe that many if not all of the generic cheap clone cartridges may originate from the same manufacturing plant in China.  I just ran another print diagnostic and all is good.  As a result I have increased the number of stars to 4.

I've got an HP Officejet 7000.  I've had it for some time and don't use it that much.  It costs a fortune to buy official OEM HP ink cartridges.  A full set of HP ink cartridges is about $100.  These cost just over $11.  At this price, it's unreasonable to expect the exact same quality as genuine HP cartridges.  The cartridges seem properly constructed.  I put in the magenta cartridge and ran a number of diagnostics.  Initially it worked okay.  On 6/15/2018, I found that the cartridge smeared ink.  I replaced it with another brand.  My initial rating was 2 stars.

On 8/2/2018, I installed the yellow cartridge.  The yellow is still working fine.  Because the yellow is working, it could be that the magenta was a not typical.  I raised the number of stars to 3 as a result, because 1/2 of the tested cartridges worked and the low price. Yellow is fine, 1st cartridge failed, MIROO sent replacements, more to test"

3921661,B016XTRBIU,1,Never worked One Star
3921662,B016XTRBIU,5,Be careful. The printer knows. Somehow the printer will tell you you are putting in non hp ink but will still work with it. I recommend switching all at the same time if possible. Best ink ever. Never buying hp ink again.
3921663,B016XTRBIU,5,"I have been buying these cartridges for over 2 years now. They work as well as the OEM cartridges and even report when they are low/out of ink. You will still get the warning that they are not Genuine HP ink cartridges, but it is a minor inconvenience at best.

My wife is a teacher and often has to print materials at home when the copiers/printers at school are down (or the budget doesn't allow them supplies). The colors always look true and with our large format printer we have printed poster size educational materials without trouble from these cartridges. They really work and even report ink levels!"
3921664,B016XTRBIU,5,"Fast service, works great, good price works great, good"
3921665,B016XTRBIU,5,"Although the printer reports non-Original HP Ink, these cartridges work great!!! these cartridges work great!!"
3921666,B016XTRBIU,5,"Currently using the 3 color and one of the black cartridges since first week of March 2018. Absolutely fine. No problems. Yes, XL size.

What do I like best? THE PRICE as well as the performance.

I normally bought the HP cartridges from Sams store. Three colors and 2 black cost me $127.29 plus $8.91 tax. Compared to $14.77 from Miroo. delivered in two days via Prime, no shipping cost. That's a savings of $121.43. That alone pays for 8.8 months of my Prime membership!!!!!

My only disappointment is that Miroo does not carry cartridges for my very old HP 1210 printer. Absolutely fine. No problems"
3921667,B016XTRBIU,4,"So far, so good, not really fair to rate these cartridges until I have used them up. Obviously how long they last is of utmost importance. I can only say that they are working perfectly so far, but I have only printed very few documents and pictures. I will try to update my review after having had more experience with the product. So far, so good, more time needed to give an honest assessment"
3921668,B016XTRBIU,1,I did not work. Had to take them out & install HP cartridges. Total waste of my money Total waste of my money
3921669,B016XTRBIU,4,"So far, so good...No leaks...Yet... so good.."
3921670,B016XTRBIU,4,Initially my HP did not see black cartridge. So I sanded contacts once and it helped. So far so good. No more issues. So far so good. No more issues
3921671,B016XTRBIU,1,DIdn't work with my HP printer at all. It rejected it as fake. Doesn't work
3921672,B016XTRBIU,5,"I've been very happy with the quality of these replacement cartridges. They have worked perfectly and the price is great. I have absolutely no complaints and will definitely order more in the future. I've had issues in the past with non-HP cartridges leaking ink, but these appear to be high quality and so far have lasted longer than HP cartridges. Good value and performance"
3921673,B016XTRBIU,5,"My printer died the day before I received the HP 920 ink, and of course my new printer uses a different style cartridge.
I'm now looking for someone to inherit the HP 920 ink at no charge...Sorry...Very sorry... My printer died the day before I received the HP ..."
3921674,B016XTRBIU,5,Worked perfectly for my older printer.  Way cheaper then buying HP brand.  Save yourself some cash. Cheaper and works fine.
3921675,B016XTRBIU,4,"Wanted to quash any fears of purchasing this product.
Admitting I took a chance as this is a non-OEM product so I read as many of the reviews as possible and did see some buyers had issues. And I do understand some of my friends can get in over their head with the simplest of tasks like maintaining a clean print head. But I am here to tell you; this product is a perfect fit with complete functionality and quality. I would recommend this lesser in price, (65% less), alternative. Maybe HP will get the memo to be more competitive with ink and toner. I WILL buy this product again!

I think all negative reviews are from competitors, ignore them and give it a try, you can't go wrong with this price. After one year still working fine"
3921695,B016XTRBIU,4,The ink cartridges fit into my printer perfectly and printed just as I expected. A good product overall. They fit perfect in the printer
3921696,B016XTRBIU,1,Only because I ordered the wrong number so it is my fault not the company's One Star
3921697,B016XTRBIU,5,"The ink cartridge was bought to replace genuine HP ink cartridges that were bought last year. The genuine HP ink worked well, but didn't last long at all. This time I did some research about replacement and found MIROO. Just like most online shoppers, I read the item description, features, and other reviews before ordering. This purchase is really a good deal in terms of price, shipping, and customer service. The ink cartridges have worked just as the seller has described. The warning on the printer isn't an issue at all. The prints look as good as using genuine HP ink. There is one tip for other shoppers: place the ink cartridges upright for one minute before installing them to your printer. I read this either from the seller or another reviewer. SO I didn't experience any leak issue. With the unbeatable price and durability, I am happy about this purchase. Hope this time the ink cartridges will last long. Good quality with reasonable price"

3921704,B016XTRBIU,5,"Well when you see what the major manufacturers charge for these and then try these, makes you resent the obvious gouge.  These worked perfectly for me with the exception that every print process, my printer will not print until it tells me that they are not genuine XX printer cartridges and makes me click ok before it will print.  Another annoyance from the printer people, not these cartridges.  I will never pay for XX cartridges again and I resent that they have built in the ""these are not genuine ....""  and you can't disable it.  Now we just need these cartridge people to start making printers so I don't get that annoying message.  Nice.... Works Perfect, Printer Manufacturer doesn't like it, Whaaah...."

Put back in empty HP cartridges and still got the error message. I can't even run any cleaning or alignment functions through printer menus. No two ways about it, these cartridges killed my previously functional printer. Sure, the scanner still works, but so what.
UPDATE:
Was contacted by the company. Was offered a solution that did not work, then offered replacement of the product (to be used in a printer that no longer works), and finally offered a refund which I accepted. They then sent following message: ""Would you please up.date or get rid of the Review. Thanks"" Killed my printer. Lesson learned."

3921741,B016XTRBIU,5,"I purchased this 6/17/17, so 9 months later and WOW! I don't print often, however today I just printed 150 pages on 65lb card stock for some baby shower games and I am so impressed I am typing this up on my lunch hour. I was worried to buy generic originally, but now I couldn't be happier about it. With the name brand product it seemed like because I printed so little I would have to buy new each time cause it dried out! I couldn't believe how often I was buying ink for how little I printed. These babies those are magic. MAGIC. Still ink left by the way. And the items I printed are graphic heavy hence the reason I am printing on 65lb card stock. Two thumbs up for sure. MAGIC BABY"
3921742,B016XTRBIU,5,It was my first Miroo purchase and I was worried it might not work with my HP printer. Works fantastic and Ill never go back to spending $80 for ink replacement! A big thank you!!! GREAT ALTERNATIVE!

3921744,B016XTRBIU,5,"For the price comparison between similar products, after using the printer ink, the ink does seem worth the value. Yes the printer will say HP printer not installed however easily bypassed. The ink does go quickly. Some jams occurred that usually don't and a leak from the black cartridge when I initially installed that lost a good amount of the ink. With that being said, still worth the value. Good for quick replacement at a low price! Worth the price"
3921745,B016XTRBIU,5,"*edit: customer service emailed me after I posted my original review. They gave me a few steps to do and it worked! You need to clean the ink head about 5-6 times and it works!

I knew this was too good to be true. The black is grey. I cant speak for the other colors as I haven't printed anything in color yet. I was excited to get this ink for the price but you get what you pay for. Black ink isn't black"

3921913,B016XTRBIU,4,"It came in a package of 3 cartridges, the first one I put in leaked. What a nightmare ! It left blotches on the paper, and ink on my hands. Well it was not a lot of ink, but let me tell you the ink smears and when a little got on to my clothes it it a disaster. It does not come out from my pants and took a few days to come off my hands even with scrubbing. At first I thought I did something wrong. I cleaned and re-inserted the cartrg. Same thing, but I had copies to make so I inserted the next one and that went fine, worked as expected. So far I am on cartg. number two and all is well.

For the price to returning, it is not worth the effort to send back, but the mess that it caused has me thinking twice about cheap ink. I guess it could happen with HP ink ? For me it was not worth any saving. The mess did not outweigh the saving. It may have been just one bad one out of hundreds but the inconvenience and mess was not acceptable.""

For the price to returning, it is not worth the effort to send back, but the mess that it caused has me thinking twice about cheap ink. I guess it could happen with HP ink ? For me it was not worth any saving. The mess did not outweigh the saving. It may have been just one bad one out of hundreds but the inconvenience and mess was not acceptable."" but I had copies to make so I inserted the next one and that went fine, worked as expected  Revised Dec 6th..The seller wrote ba"
3921914,B016XTRBIU,4,"There was a some work to get these to function properly since they are not OEM cartridges, but the seller was helpful in provided email directions and it wasn't hard to do.  Seems to print well.  The ink gauge shows only about 2/3 full, but I ma not sure if this is due to less ink or the chip doesn't communicate fully since it is non OEM.  All in all a good value given the significant price difference to OEM.  My old printer has a new lease on life. All in all a good value given the significant price difference to OEM"
3921915,B016XTRBIU,5,I have used these for a couple of cycles now and no problem on my HP Printer Worked like a charm
3921916,B016XTRBIU,5,"Need a good black ink replacement cartridge? Look no further than this seller. I ordered two or three of these items. They arrived in 2 days as offered. I followed instructions in the package. I installed them properly. Viola!! I cannot tell you how pleased I am with the use of this item.
Thanks! Best black printer ink for your HP Officejet 6500 Wireless"
3921917,B016XTRBIU,4,"Works great, arrived on time and easy to install. Good HP replacement,"
3921918,B016XTRBIU,5,"Work just like hp but for significantly less.
Still comes up with a message non- hp product., I just acknowledged and move on. Now I can save my arm and leg for the tax man and not HP. Great low price product!"
3921919,B016XTRBIU,5,I like it Five Stars
3921920,B016XTRBIU,5,Product is just like Oem and works great! Five Stars
3921921,B016XTRBIU,4,"It is not working now.  I might have used this to print may be 20-30 pages.  The print is not clear at all especially black.  Color prints very light. After cleaning the printerhead, the cartridge is working good. Five Stars"
3921922,B016XTRBIU,5,"Received their ink and installed in my HP 6500 printer. No issue, no problems.  Working fine.
Certainly will be buying again.  People who have issues are doing something wrong, IMHO.
They have plenty of ink.
This is what the HP cartridges should be. Working great and price point is awsome.  Goodby HP ink."
3921923,B016XTRBIU,5,"Great product, fits well and ink quality is beyond my expectations. Overall great product. Would buy again!"
3921924,B016XTRBIU,5,"GREAT ink ...works perfectly in my HP printer, even though HP occasionally reminds me that they are not ""official"" HP cartridges. Ha, Ha, I have been using these for a long time and they do very detailed precision printing without fail ... Love the cartridges; they work perfectly"
3921925,B016XTRBIU,5,So far so good. Works in my printer and estimates ink left. How long it will last only time will tell. So far so good
3921927,B016XTRBIU,5,"So far, so good.  Just replaced the ink cartridges two days ago and have had no problems since I cleaned the printer head. It was a little bit messier as a couple ink spots dropped out.  However the price of these cartridges outweighed a couple ink spills. So far, so good"
3921928,B016XTRBIU,5,"This product is exactly the item I was needing. I have a business I'm trying to get off the ground so I've limited myself on the amount of money I spend. My printer's ink cost over $40 just for black ink. There was no way that I could afford it. Your ink was definitely within budget, so I thought I'd give it a try. It has proven to be a smart decision. This product is absolutely worth purchasing! Thank you. This ink is worth buying!!"

3921930,B016XTRBIU,5,"this product arrived much sooner than expected and I'm 3000 miles away from where it shipped, not only does it fit the printer perfectly the printer reads it as if it is a genuine HP product. you can't beat the price and you can't beat the customer service thus far. I would highly recommend the product and the company. exceeded all expectations"

3921937,B016XTRBIU,5,Best buy for printer ink. Five Stars
3921938,B016XTRBIU,5,"prints well, but the printer recognizes that they are not original and displays a warning message every time and you have to try it more than once so that you can print prints well,"

3921944,B016XTRBIU,5,This is my second time ordering this ink. The first batch worked perfectly. I installed one of the black ink cartridges yesterday from the new pack I got and its working fine so far. Highly recommend this cost-effective ink! Works perfectly
3921945,B016XTRBIU,5,"so far so good, still didn't try color print. Good value for the price. Hope lasts a bit. Five Stars"
3921946,B016XTRBIU,5,"I refurbished the print head (full five minute per nozzle hot water flush / reverse flush process), dried the ports then installed these cartridges and a really blocked print head became a thing of instant and inexpensive joy. Cartridges read the chips as full and 6500a printed flawlessly. Would certainly buy again. The print head with these inks, is working so well now that I was able to adjust the ink volume lower. Great Pricing - Flawless Printing - First Time User"
3921947,B016XTRBIU,5,"great quality, only thing is that my printer recognizes that the cartridges are not hp and gives me an annoying prompt every time that I start my printer. perhaps future cartridges can fool the printer? great quality, only thing is that my printer recognizes ..."

3921949,B016XTRBIU,2,"I ordered these for my home office printer hoping to save a little money over the HP originals.  The color cartridges worked ok, but the black cartridge smudged from nearly the first use.  Cleaning the machine, checking the installation of the cartridge, etc. did nothing to help.  The black and white print quality was unacceptable.  I had to order OEM originals way before these ran out to ensure that what I send to clients and others looks professional.  Very disappointing. Very Disappointing"

3921954,B016XTRBIU,5,"The print states that the cartridges are not HP but once you override the warning they work just fine! So much cheaper too, I may need to order more soon just to keep some backups. Works just like the regular ones after you confirm they are not HP with the printer"

3921960,B016XTRBIU,5,Ink is great! Arrived timely I'm still printing with the first set of cartridges. Great ink!
3921961,B016XTRBIU,5,"First time ordering this ink.  Price point was great.  Had a bit of a slow start getting the colors to come together but after a few test pages and a printer head cleaning/test cycle or two everything looks great!

HP is not happy and notes the ""unauthorized ink"" but I DO get ink level reporting and functionality, given the chip inclusion--for $60 less!!!

Nice to know where to get reasonably priced non-OEM (OEM criminals!--see FTA) replacement ink cartridges.

MIROO will be my Ink source from now on. MIROO will be my Ink source from now on."
3921962,B016XTRBIU,1,These are terrible.  Less than 5 pages printed and they have started to behave like empty cartridges.  When they do print they are sloppy and print blurry letters. Don't Do It.
3921963,B016XTRBIU,5,They work well Five Stars
3921964,B016XTRBIU,1,"Absolutely not compatible wth the officejet 6000. Printer does not recognize the yellow one, and the black one does not work.

3921965,B016XTRBIU,5,Gone are the days of paying 50-60 dollars for replacement printer ink!  This ink works identically to  the HP ink that I used to buy for a fraction of the price.  Try it once and you'll be hooked! Gone are the days of paying 50-60 dollars for replacement ...
3921966,B016XTRBIU,5,"Glad there is an alternative that works well.  Used HP Cartridges for years paying the high price and in some cases the ink was gone in no time or dried up when inserting.  However, when using Mirco Cmpatible, I get two warning notices clicking OK before it prints my page.  HP does not like it but I can't afford marginal quality at their high prices.  This is a very old model, you would think they would give us a break. A Nice Alternative"
3921967,B016XTRBIU,5,The ink cartridges I ordered work great!  I can't tell the difference between them and the  manufacturer's ink except the price. Will buy again
3921968,B016XTRBIU,5,Ink works great! Five Stars
3921969,B016XTRBIU,4,"Great deal for printer ink. My HP printer keeps telling me I do not have official hp ink installed, but I am able to print without a problem. The only issue so far is that my first yellow cartridge stopped working even though there was still ink in it so I had to switch it out. Great deal"
3921970,B016XTRBIU,5,These came on time with clear instructions for replacement.  I especially appreciate the affordability! Five Stars

3921988,B016XTRBIU,5,I gave 5 stars to this product but I really did not get the chance to try it. My printer had other issues and I ended up dumping it. Nice packed product
3921989,B016XTRBIU,1,Ink did not work for my HP printer. Caused a malfunction with printer head and damaged my printer. Had to buy a whole new printer. Horrible product

3921991,B016XTRBIU,1,"I am a bit dissapointed with the performance of this ink(yellow).  I can understand the colors are not as sharp as hp 920.
However, it leaves a streak of yellow across the center of photo print on photo paper. So I cannot use this ink when
printing on photo papers. Yellow ink bleed on photo paper."
3921992,B016XTRBIU,1,"I asked for replacement cartridges for my HP 6968 printer and this product stated it would work.  Price was great, but my HP does not accept the cartridges.  BEWARE as this is false advertising. False advertising"
3921993,B016XTRBIU,5,"Ink Cartridges are so expensive if you buy them from the manufacturers of the product you are using.

I ordered it and even if I paid for postage I received the product, installed them in my HP printer and they work just as fine and perfectly as the original cartridges.

3922007,B016XTRBIU,4,"Can't beat the price, but it's definitely annoying that I have to tell the printer to clean the printhead every single time I go to print.  If I don't have it clean the printhead, the ink appears blurred or missing.  As soon as I clean the printhead, it prints perfectly (for a few minutes, then I have to clean the printhead again).

The company did send me a complimentary replacement which is working fine, so I bumped my review to 4 stars instead of 3. Constantly Cleaning the Printhead"
3922008,B016XTRBIU,1,"They did not work at all in my HP6500A printer.

When I needed them my printer rejected them with an error message saying ""please insert ink cartridges""

So I went to a local Staples and got HP 920 carrridges and they worked just fine. But they were about 4X the price.

Previously I had either used HP ink cartridge or some other cheaper cartridge which typically had compatibility issues where the printer would not recognize the ink and would not show the ink status. With this product, however, not only does this work great, my printer recognizes the ink and shows me the ink status. Very glad that I decided to buy this and will buy it again the next time!

3922026,B016XTRBIU,4,"When I first used these cartridges the colors looked washed out.  The company saw my review, contacted me immediately and suggested a fix - making sure that the air pressure in the cartridge was correct - and easy fix.
After doing that the quality improved greatly, and the colors were much more faithful, and of course, with photo-paper the colors were rendered even better.
I am using an HP Officejet 6500 E709N, and I am sure that the printer has its limitations and contribute to the outcome - so your experience might even be better.
These are a very good less expensive alternative to the OEM cartridges. And as a bonus the customer service was great. Very good replacement cartridges at a very good price."

3922033,B016XTRBIU,4,"It works okay, but if you are looking for defined color print, it will lack. Some colors does not come out as it should, some do. For what I use, it is ok. I can live with some inaccurate coloring once in a while. You have to choose a color that is close to the primary. It works okay, but if you are looking for defined color print, it will disappoint a little."

3922036,B016XTRBIU,5,Great ink and a great price! I can tell no difference in this and the HP high cost ink. Customer service sent a couple of emails as well to make sure I was satisfied with my purchase and the quality. We'll definitely purchase again. Great ink and a great price
3922037,B016XTRBIU,5,Best bang for the buck Great product
3922038,B016XTRBIU,1,"I was able to print exactly 7 sheets using this ink. The first green colored sheet was streaky and then after the first page of using yellow,  the yellow ink would not print any more. Then I had error messages to remove the ink and replace the printhead. Now it won't print at all. Wish I could of just paid the money to get the HP ink. Waste of time, money and now I have to fix the printer. Waste of time"
3922039,B016XTRBIU,5,Worked well and efficiently !!!! Perfect replacement! Great Product
3922040,B016XTRBIU,4,"Update 12/28/17. I had to manipulate the black cartridge a bit for the ink to start coming through. I have had numerous attempts from the company to update my review. The product itself is good, not perfect. Customer service rep was very persistent on having me change my review or deleting it.

Update 9/1/17. The color cartridges are printing fine but the black ink is not coming through. I changed the cartridge and aligned cartridges and still nothing. I'm disappointed in the outcome.

The ink cartridges print well. I'm still having issues with the printer saying ""reload cartridges"", ""turn printer off and on"", etc. Once I acknowledge that the cartridges are non-HP the printer stops printing entirely and I have to unplug, reset the printer. The color is vibrant. I did not have an issue with leaking as others customers did. Techie issues"
3922041,B016XTRBIU,5,"After having the first black cartridge not work properly, the seller actually sent me 3 replacements.  I haven't tried them yet, but they do feel heavy, like a new cartridge should. The original seemed light and likely, in my estimation, some sort of manufacturing defect.  I'm retracting my 1 star and giving a 5 star for the prompt reissuance of ink. Great customer service!"

3922046,B016XTRBIU,5,"These cartridges work great!  Was careful opening them as some users said they were so full that they spilled a little.  Can't see any difference in print quality as compared to HP brand name!  Yes, my HP gives me a message that I have non-HP cartridges installed, but the price difference is certainly worth having to press the button to clear that on the display when I print.  Shipping was quick, and the cartridges come well packed in a cardboard box, a perfect box to put my old cartridges in to bring to the store for recycling. Save money when you print!"
3922047,B016XTRBIU,5,"works as it should, cartridges are full,you can see the ink in them. When you buy HP ink they don't fill the cartridge all the way full so they don't last as long. They are less than a 1/4 of the price compared to HP ink. Never will I buy ink from Staples or Office Depot again. Also, very fast shipping. Great deal! Great deal!"
3922048,B016XTRBIU,4,Great just wish they lasted longer! Four Stars
3922049,B016XTRBIU,4,"Well...On a whim I decided to these cartridges. First let me say they are a lil flimsy and my first order had 2 cracked inks, and they leaked everywhere. So when I received a replacement set from the company I was pleasantly surprised how good they worked. They feel a lil thin , and the clear case threw me off a lil bit, but they work just fine. And for the price would I buy them again... Well YES I would. Originally this was gonna be a 3 star rating , but the customer service bumped it up to 4... Worth the Value"

3922062,B016XTRBIU,4,"Updated review:
After having issues with the black ink failing to be recognized by my HP 6500, customer service reached out to me and sent replacements to try. The printer has been working fine now for a few jobs so perhaps the original was a dud. However, I was very appreciative of the effort over multiple emails for customer service to identify the problem, offer solutions to try and finally coordinate a replacement. I was sure I was just going to have to eat the cost. Thank you for helping!

Initial review:
Printer recognizes and will not function with off-brand ink. So I have full ink cartridges that I paid for and a printer that will not operate if they are installed. My printer is now worthless ---- Updated"

3922070,B016XTRBIU,5,"The three colored inks are working but the black didn't . I emailed the seller and to my surprise, within few minutes, someone replied and helped me troubleshoot. The seller won't stop communicating until they helped me.  Unfortunately, the black ink won't really work. She sent me another black cartridge and this time it worked fine. That wasn't a big deal for me that the first black cartridge didn't work. Even original and branded products sometimes do have issues. I have been using original HP ink for several years with the same printer and honestly, I don't see any difference at all. I would recommend this to everyone. five star"
3922071,B016XTRBIU,5,Was very please. Wasn't sure when I order it because my husband said I should have order the HP brand but didn't.  It worked great in our HP 6500 printer. It worked great in our HP 6500 printer
3922072,B016XTRBIU,4,I got this for our older printer. The printer complained a little about not being HP ink but after hitting the OK button a few times they worked.

3922076,B016XTRBIU,5,"Would definitely buy again.  Was surprised how good the quality of ink was for such a low price.  Be careful to read instruction card carefully to avoid accidental ink spillage, because apparently there are different ways to install the cartridges based on the contents of the box received Great product for a low price"
3922077,B016XTRBIU,2,"I haven't had much success with non-HP ink cartridges, but I tried these because of the good reviews and the low price.
The first black cartridge I tried didn't work well. An airline boarding pass I printed would not scan at the TSA screening. At least one of the color cartridges is also bad. A photo I printed has streaks.
Other purchasers have had good results, but I wasn't so lucky.

Update:
The color cartridges now appear to be OK.
The seller suggested ways to get the cartridges to work, but I expected them to work without extra procedures. The seller offered a refund, which I accepted. Not lucky"
3922078,B016XTRBIU,5,I have been using the ink for about a month. So far I have had no issue with my printer. I would strongly recommend this product at so affordable price. I would strongly recommend this product at so affordable price

3922084,B016XTRBIU,5,"I tried this on a whim, thinking there is no way these would work for the price.  I put all 3 color cartridges in at the same time and have not had any problems as of yet.  I have not tried the black cartridge yet.  I am not sure on how long these will last but so far so good.  When I print from my computer I get an error message saying I do not have genuine cartridges in but that can be dismissed.  Airplay printing works fine and I have not noticed a decrease in print quality. I would definitely buy again."
3922085,B016XTRBIU,5,"This cost less than ONE small HP color cartridge, for all colors and the large black. So far it all works. My printer complained it wasn't official but just said press ok then worked fine. Ink looks just fine. HP ink is insanely priced. This is so cheap I was afraid it wouldn't work, but they do! Skip taking a loan out go"
3922086,B016XTRBIU,2,"HP printers do not like aftermarket ink cartridges!!  Customer service here is very good with a quick response, (hence 2 stars) but having to cycle the printer off and on and re-insert the cartridges several times  to complete each print job is a bit excessive to save $20.  In addition the colors are not true, and they tend to run through the print head leaving streaks.  I have purchased several different replacement brands for a few different printers and have had no positive results.  The initial cost is inexpensive so I keep believing I will eventually get away with something - someday.  So far expectations have met with the price point.  Even though the cost of OE ink is high, the results will have to speak for themselves. You get what you pay for"
3922087,B016XTRBIU,5,"The ink works great and is so much cheaper than HP ink! Like others have commented, you will get a warning notification every time you use your printer saying that the ink is not HP ink and the printer will not be covered in warranty if you use it. For me, this doesn't matter since my printer is pretty old by now. Great inexpensive alternative to HP"
3922088,B016XTRBIU,5,"This was purchased for my daughter's teacher. She at first said it didn't work, due to her printer giving her errors, but we were able to figure it out and it worked fine.  She was so surprised to find that the price of this ink was so reasonable, compared to the prices she had been paying at a name brand office supply store. I will most definitely purchase again if I need to. Amazing price and works great!"
3922089,B016XTRBIU,5,I love these ink cartridges! Lower price than the original but last just as long and really good quality! I highly recommend these!! I love these ink cartridges

3922094,B016XTRBIU,4,One of the black cartridges did not work in my HP Officejet 6500 but the seller replaced it immediately upon contact.  The replacement and all of the color cartridges work great.  And what a great price Small problem that was quickly resolved.
3922095,B016XTRBIU,5,"The price difference between these cartridges and the official HP cartridges is crazy. That alone prompted me to buy a set and see how they worked. So far, so good, but I haven't done a lot of printing with them. Also, my older printer, an HP Officejet 6500A Plus, doesn't like to recognize these cartridges. Every time I print it locks up, and I have to click ""OK"", to activate the print sequence. But, for the difference in price, which as stated previously is Crazy, it's worth it. So, I'm a believer. I just ordered my second set of cartridges, and they are working fine. Also, you can see how much ink is left."

3922105,B016XTRBIU,5,"They work perfectly in my HP 6500.  At the beginning the black cartridge was not printing.  The manufacturer recommended me to shake the cartridge for a couple of minutes and try again.  It didn't work.  I was suspecting that my printer was the culprit.  I ran the HP alignment and printhead cleaning procedures, consumed a lot of ink (except black) but still not getting the black ink to print.
Then I pulled out the print heads, cleaned them under the faucet, printed a few pages and now everything is working fine.  You can't beat the price!

3922184,B016XTRBIU,5,"I am a firm believer in purchasing off brand ink, because it is so much more reasonably priced and does the job just fine for what I need! This product worked well with my HP Inkjet printer. Of course the printer always throws a little fit when you first install the ink, but after clicking ""OK"" to a non-HP cartridge, it works perfectly well. Great product. because it is so much more reasonably priced and does the job just fine for what I need"

3922191,B016XTRBIU,5,"The black ink cartridge that came was a high-yield version, yet it lasted only a few weeks and after only about 25 pages.  I noted this in my original review and the company responded quickly by sending me another set free of charge. As such, I have updated my rating from two stars to five stars because of their excellent customer service...... Black ink cartridge nearly empty when received, but received replacement immediately.  Excellent customer service!"
3922192,B016XTRBIU,5,"I've tried several generic brands to avoid paying the high HP ink prices. This ink did not leak and worked great, once I used the tool to align the print cartridges. I will purchase again! Great print quality-much lower price point!"
3922193,B016XTRBIU,5,"Great ink cartridges for a great price!!  Print quality same as the pricey HP cartridges.  Took advise of one reviewer to ""dab the ink hole on the ink cartridge BEFORE inserting"".  Had no issues whatsoever.  Used on HP 6500 printer and got message ""not using HP ink cartridge"".  Just had to keep hitting the ""OK"" button to print and the quality was excellent.  Highly recommend purchasing. Great ink cartridges for a great price"

Thanks for your email, sorry for the delay.
so sorry that our product let u down,could u please give us a chance to fix it.
could u please share of the printer model u referring to?
Don't worry about our guys,There have some solution you may need:
If it doesn't recognize,u can try to polish the chiptop of the cartridge) with rubber or alcohol,  power off and on with your printer, re-install them several times.
If it fail to printer out, vigorously shake it about 2-3 minutes with a piece of paper cover the ink hole(with the ink hole down when shaking it),Put it aside for several minutes.

Customer satisfactory is very important for our guys,If u think we have resolved your issue,A great review would be much appreciated.

3922227,B016XTRBIU,5,"Product installed easily.  For whatever reason, first few pages didn't print all that well.  Could be that we had exhausted the HP cartridges that were in the machine too much.  But, now it's fine. Love the product and will purchase again. What a savings over HP... Product installed easily. For whatever reason"
3922229,B016XTRBIU,1,Put this in my HP printer and it said that it was not a genuine HP Cartridge and would not accept it.  Total waste of money! Doesn't work in HP 6500
3922230,B016XTRBIU,1,Don't waste your money. Ink came out green/yellow when I printed in color. Nope...
3922231,B016XTRBIU,5,"I was a little hesitant with some of the negative reviews.  Product came in a closed cardboard container with each cartridge sealed in plastic.  Installation was simple in my HP 6500 printer. Following the instructions, I flipped over the cartridge and gently removed the orange cap hoping ink wouldn't spill out.  None did.  Printed a test page and the quality is good enough for me.

For the price and speed of delivery, I'll definitely buy it again. Great product!"

3922235,B016XTRBIU,5,"I have worked for many years with non-OEM accessories for my printer needs and must say that I am very impressed with the quality that this company has demonstrated. I hope that they expand their line so that many of the most popular printers are included in their service line.  It would be best that they publish a line of printers that they intend to support so customers can refer to this list when they are considering a printer purchase. Good Job, MIROO!!!!! EXCELLENT PRODUCT.......MIROO!!!!!!!!!!!"
3922236,B016XTRBIU,1,"I got my cartridges and all of the colors seem to work fine but the black will not work in fact it has leaked out and probably ruined by printer,  I have black ink all over inside the printer. Black won't work"

3922238,B016XTRBIU,5,So far so good. Before I bought ink cartridges from another business (through Amazon) and the black ink cartridge was leaking when I opened it. It made a mess on my desk and my hands. Very unhappy about this incident. Yours are working fine. So far so good .......

Ink worked as expected. no problems."
3922240,B016XTRBIU,5,"So far so good!  I've ordered twice and it worked great both times. I'm greatful that I found this cheaper ink.

3922257,B016XTRBIU,5,I have to admit that I was very skeptical before I ordered these cartridges because the price was so ridiculously low.  I am happy to report that my suspicions were unfounded and that these cartridges are as good as any HP cartridge on the market and at a fraction of the price.  Buy with confidence. A great deal on cartridges
3922258,B016XTRBIU,1,"The black cartridge works fine and the blue ink comes out, but the other two have never worked.  As a result, I'm left with no ability to print color.

3922293,B016XTRBIU,5,"I opened them, installed them, and they worked. I didn't have the ink on my hands issue other people have had. I printed a color picture and the color appeared to be fine. The only drawback was that it came in a padded envelope. I really don't feel that is sufficient protection for ink cartridges. I didn't penalize a star for that because there was a separate review for packaging, but wanted to make potential buyers aware. Great value."

3922302,B016XTRBIU,4,"Update,
The supplier contacted me right away and offered me a full refund or replacement Cartridges. I chose replacements and have installed them and tested them and they work well. The streaks are all gone and the colors are all correct. I don't do photo printing so I cannot comment on how well they would work for that, but for everyday color printing charts, graphs signs, etc. these work very well.

The customer service was very good  I retained my original review for reference

Original review
All of these Cartridges were detected as non-HP, which is about par for HP printers and why I will never buy another HP product. But I digress. The black cartridge works just fine but the colored ones do not. It appears the problem may be with the Cyan cartridge since anything that is blue contains pinkish res streaks in it. I didn't expect these to be photo quality, but  inch wide pink streaks in the blue areas is unacceptable. I am running them a bit to see if this improves. Worked Good on 2nd try Very good customer service"
3922303,B016XTRBIU,1,"Well, I thought this was too good to be true, and I was right!  The color is very very light and dull.  The black is printing as grey and the color comes out like water colors.  This is one of those ""you get what you pay for"" products.  Disappointed. you get what you pay for :("

The only change is tapping OK to the warning that comes up on the screen that these are not HP inks. Not bad for an 85% discount. Super deal!

3922339,B016XTRBIU,5,"The only issue is HP has programed their printers to nag about non OEM ink. The ink works marvelous. The poor reviews about spilling ink from others are idiotic, it's ink, and if your not careful it might drop when handling it,duh. Can't beat the quilaty for the price!"

3922351,B016XTRBIU,5,"I have not installed the black cartridge as yet but I have installed the color cartridges and they are working fine. Initially, my printer refused to accept them and gave me error warnings. I removed them and polished the contacts on all three cartages with a pencil eraser. I reinstalled them and it all went well. They seem to work as well as the OEM cartridge. The color quality is bright with excellent saturation. All in all, I am happy with this purchase and very happy with the price break over the OEM ink cartridges. I will definitely purchase them again. ... have installed the color cartridges and they are working fine. Initially"
3922352,B016XTRBIU,4,After several attempts by the printer to align the cartridges it now seems to be working without issue.  For the cheaper price to have a little bit of extra work is probably to be expected.  At half price of genuine hp it is probably worth it A little extra effort probably worth the savings

3922379,B016XTRBIU,5,"This is a great product.  I use them and have been able to keep my older HP printer going for years.  The colors come out great and the whole set of cartridges is just a fraction of the cost of HP cartridges.  But they work great.  Just remember to remove all the plastic off the outside of the cartridge because there is a little air hole and it has to be free in order for the cartridge to work. Great Cartridges,  no problems, a fraction of the cost."

3922381,B016XTRBIU,5,"I was so ticked off when I had to buy HP toner and it was going to cost me $90 from the local office store. I found this gem of a product for $10 and thought I would give it a try. I installed them, ran cleaning cycle and printed perfectly. No more $90 toner for me! Worked perfect."
3922382,B016XTRBIU,4,"The color ink printed beautifully. The black ink never worked and leakd on my printer and hands a bit.  The instructions say to contact the seller through Amazon but there is no contact seller options so I was not able to contact the manufacturer.  I was really hoping this would work but no luck.
Update. They happily sent a replacement which prints perfectly. Really worth the hassle for the price difference. If you need to return seal in plastic bag because mine leaked through the cardboard box oops Took two tries but worth it"

3922391,B016XTRBIU,5,"This ink pack (for my OfficeJet 6500) worked exactly (no difference at all) the same as a pack of HP branded ink.  I installed the cartridges, ran a head cleaning (standard procedure), and they passed every test.  The print quality is no different than before, but the cost was MUCH less expensive.  This is my new source of printer ink going forward. A MUCH better deal for ink refills...same quality, less cost."

I have never had a screen shatter, and i drop my phone more often than I would like to admit. So, I'm very disappointed. Wish I had left my other case on it now. It wasn't much bulk savings at all. Not worth the damage. Liked it out of the box & on my phone"
3922396,B016XTRBIU,5,"I feel compelled to leave a review on this purchase.  I've had poor success in the past using budget inks.  But, this ink for my HP6500 printer performs flawlessly.  Installation was easy.  The printer does give a message that the ink is non-HP ink, but, just press OK, and move on.  The printer automatically went thru a quick cleaning cycle, and from the very first print, the colors are perfect.  No discernible difference from the previous HP OEM ink.  I haven't installed the Miroo black ink yet, since the HP ink is still mostly full.  I will definitely buy again. I've had poor success in the past using budget inks"

3922402,B016XTRBIU,1,"I ordered this cartridge ONCE and while they initially installed and worked like OEM, after a week of light printing (a few sheets here and there) the colors stopped printing all together. I opened the cartridge bay to investigate and found the MIROO XL black tank COMPLETELY EMPTY and the resting position of the cartridge sled (all the way on the right) completely SOAKED with all the ink that leaked out of the black cartridge! What's EVEN WORSE is that the shear volume of the cartridge leaking has destroyed the ability for the printer to do its normal operating functions and has  completely short circuited all three of the color cartridges. BASICALLY MIROO 920 INK CARTRIDGES DESTROYED MY OTHERWISE AWESOME (and expensive) HP OfficeJet 6500A Plus printer! DO NOT BUY, BLACK CARTRIDGE LEAKS TILL EMPTY AND DESTROYS PRINTER!!!"
3922403,B016XTRBIU,5,Worked perfect on my printer Five Stars
3922404,B016XTRBIU,4,"It seems to work well. Color is true and print is clear. It was a pain in the neck to get my older HP printer to work with them. I ended up having to download the latest firmware. On older printers (mine is 3 years old), HP had hard restrictions on the use of non HP ink. I think they lost a lawsuit or something because on the newer printers there is no problem other than a warning message (my wife has a new
HP printer and generic ink worked from day 1). In short, if you getting a ink error message, download and install the latest firmware/software for your model printer (you'll need to be direct connected to the printer) and it will likely fix the problem. Took me about 2 hours to get it all worked out, but should be good to go from now on out. but should be good to go from now on out"

Ill be ordering more in the future. I wouldnt have re-ordered if they didn't get the job done and these cartridges work just fine for me"
3922424,B016XTRBIU,1,"UPDATE:  Jan 2017:  All I can say is that at least Smartjet has good customer service.  After I wrote my last review, they said they'd send me another set of cartridges and to try again, or try the 2nd cartridge in my packet.  I did and it was still swashing around in there, I was nervous but tried it anyway.  I was really careful in loading it into the printer so it wouldn't drip.  Anyway... that part wasn't so bad.  After printing about 20 pages, it started the printer started to smear half the text on a page.  Just tried it again today juuuust to see if it was better.  And nope, still smears the text.  However, when I photocopy it seems to come out ok.  In any case, I won't buy from here again, but I do appreciate that they are responsible and persistent and have tried to solve my issue.

ORIGINAL REVIEW:  Dec 2016:  I had read the reviews  before purchasing the ink from Miroo (aka Smartjet) but decided to take a chance because hey, some were actually good reviews.  Good thing I read the bad ones though!  First of all, I took it out of the box and could hear the ink swashing around in there, which I never noticed when buying the cartridge from HP.  But it's liquid ink, so sure, why wouldn't it swash around?  Well, knowing that some other customers had issues with leaky cartridges (thank you for those who took the time to share your experience), before installing it into my printer, I made a small tray from tin foil as a test area first and held it over the foil as I took the orange cap off and turned it over.  Sure enough, it started dripping ink.  I held it like that for 10 seconds and it slowed, but then I set it down to see if it would keep leaking, and it did.  Now... in my package there was a little note from the manufacturer that asks a customer to please let them know of any issues instead of leaving a bad review.  I appreciate the effort, but, ethically, it makes more sense to me to warn other consumers.  What kind of product testing is the company doing product testing before it ships the product?  There has to be some sort of quality control instead of just taking a chance that MAYBE a customer will get a bad cartridge.  Obviously many have, and it seems people are having the same negative experience.  Fix the issue, don't just leave it to chance.  I just printed my return label... this is going back and I'll get the HP cartridge instead because I know I can trust it. Yes it drips, got it yesterday and already printed my return label"

Tried the second one and it didn't work either. Went to the Amazon reviews and saw that other people had had the same problem and had gotten a recommendation to clean the chip with alcohol, and if that didn't work, to call customer service at that point.  Tried it with the second one and it now works, but ran through several sheets of paper before it would work correctly.  The colors also don't seem to come out in the right proportions to run even fairly true to what you're printing.  Won't order again.  Price was excellent, but I got what I paid for. Won't buy again."

I've always bought genuine HP but decided to try these as the price was so good and I didn't really care if it might mess up the printer.  Packaging was great, no mess at all.  Got them installed but printer kept telling me ""not HP cartridges.""  I cleaned chip heads on cartridges with a little alcohol on a Qtip, replaced, restarted printer and kept pressing OK button when messages popped up.  Finally printed with no problem...color looks great.  Now that I know how to bypass ""not genuine"" nonsense, I would definitely buy again.  Who knows, maybe I won't even replace this printer!

3922451,B016XTRBIU,5,"I spend a small fortune buying cartridges for my HP7000 A3 printer the last few years and I came upon this product recently and quite surprised with the price.  I thought heck why not?  I am happy to say it is money well spent!
Great Price- I would pay the same for just 2 pcs of the original cartridge.  The cartridges seem to be well made, and fits perfectly in the printer head.
They came in a box too small which is probably why one of them sprung a leak in transit.  Thankfully, it was in an individual sealed plastic so it didn't explode everywhere. After the sale, a Ms. Alice got in touch and was extremely helpful with my complaint.  She offered to send another set to compensate for the faulty cartridge.

The print test pages were perfect, no bleeding or offset characters.  Colours were vibrant and spot on just as you would expect from the original.
I am in the process of printing all my Christmas labels etc and it has not faltered so far.  I will definitely buy this again! :) Best $17.77 spent"

Then, when I try to print, the pictures come out very green; not true to color.  I took them out, waited one minute and reinstalled.  The same think with the pictures.

3922480,B016XTRBIU,1,"After reading mixed reviews about non-genuine printer ink in general, I decided to give this a chance. Arrived well packaged. I installed the inks and immediately did print head alignment. Black ink was a no-go and colored inks didn't look so hot. Reran alignment and other tools to test and get ink working. Black never worked, but other colors cleaned up great. After about 5 test prints, took all ink out. The color inks had used a lot of ink for so little printing of course black was full since it never worked. At this point I gave up, repacked all of the ink and initiated a return. While these inks may work for some folks, my experience has me going back to shelling out $60 plus again for HP ink. Didn't work for me"

3922491,B016XTRBIU,5,VERY EFFICIENT PRODUCT VERY GOOD Five Stars very good ink
3922492,B016XTRBIU,4,"the ink worked very well once setup correctly. had to clean the print head from time to time with no other issues at all. Considering the price vs. HP ink cost, this is actually a great value for the price of about $10 per pack and will never buy the HP ink again based on the quality of the MIROO product quality for every day printing. the ink worked very well one setup correctly."
3922493,B016XTRBIU,5,I like the clear side walls. They allow one to fill them back up easily. Clear walls are good.
3922494,B016XTRBIU,4,Printed about 10 sheets and no longer works. Company refunded my money
3922495,B016XTRBIU,5,"I bought these not sure if the quality would be lacking due to the low price, but turned out I was pleasantly surprised.

I don't print a lot at the here at the house but when I do, I abuse my printer!  haha These load into the printer easily, printer knows they are not HP products but it they still load and work perfectly as if they are HP products.

3922498,B016XTRBIU,1,"Tried it for my HP 6500 wireless printer and it just doesnt work. Tried many options suggested by folks on the comments. But unfortunately, it doesnt work. Pls don't buy. doesnt work!"
3922499,B016XTRBIU,4,"It was a very good deal. The ink works well but my printer keeps giving an error message that the wrong ink cartridge is in. I have to turn the printer off then back on. If the printer goes to sleep & I send a page to the printer, I will have to turn it off & back on to clear the error message.

My printer is an older HP Ink jet all in one 6500 series.

Updated from 3 stars to 4.

Smart jet contacted me about my review & offered a full refund or a replacement pack. They had to contact me several times because I didn't think my glitch was worth a refund of my money. The problem is most likely my old HP printer just being a diva. She's at least 10 years old but still fully functioning! I still have the issue with the printer telling me the wrong ink cartridge is installed. I shut off the printer & turn it back on. As long as I always turn off my printer when not in use, it's really not annoying & the reboot takes about 10 seconds. Definitely worth it to me because of the price of the ink & the quality is great as well. You can beat their customer service either!

It will take awhile to run out of ink, but I will certainly re-order from Smartjet. Who knows, maybe my old printer will stop being so persnickety. I don't know ... updated"
3922500,B016XTRBIU,4,"Great Results with 75% less cost than HP. The only issue is the printer keeps warning that this is not a HP genuine cartridge. A little annoying, but for the same quality it is worth it. Great Results with 75% less cost than HP"

When I wrote Smartjet, they responded quickly, offered to replace the one that didn't work and in fact sent me 2 new ones. Haven't had any problems since. Just the one cartridge was bad and they took care of that. I'm 100% satisfied! Product works fine and service is awesome!"
3922515,B016XTRBIU,5,"This is probably one of the best replacement ink I have ever used.  The quality is good.  I have already contacted other HP ink buyers and recommended your products.

First time using a non-HP ink, and it didn't recognize it at first, but, ran the new ink function on the printer 3 times, then shut it off, and started it back up, and it ran one more time, and accepted it.  The quality of print is excellent!  No leaking or any other problems. Very satisfied"

3922518,B016XTRBIU,5,My printer was able to communicate with the cartridges to show how full they are. The ink quality seems to be really good. I have printed on high gloss paper with great success. Like it a lot
3922519,B016XTRBIU,1,"Ink doesn't work whatsoever. Printer keeps saying that there aren't HP cartridges inserted, which would be fine, if the ink actually worked. The color quality of the prints was all distorted, even with black and white, which makes no sense. Replacing all the ink cartridges to make them unified by brand just made things worse. This ink is just absolutely horrible and a waste of time. Spend the extra few dollars and buy the brand name ink to avoid having to reorder and deal with flawed prints. Even basic Pages and Word documents are flawed. which would be fine, if the ink actually worked"

These are the best remanufactured ink cartridges I have every used, and I have used many different brands.  And these are at a wonderful price.  Don't forget to let them rest upside down for three minutes before you start handling them -- this allows the ink to settle away from where it comes out once you install it !!  I did not get one drop of ink on me, and didn't even use gloves !!  Just go slowly and do it right !! I was very pleased with this product"

  I only needed to replace the CYAN/PINK in my HP Officejet 6500A Plus. I removed the old cartridges, opened these cartridges, blotted them bottom on paper towels and put them into the machine. I got the expect whine about not being HP ink, did the alignment and they seem to work for good. I will try to update this as I wear these out and install the others. Worked for my Officejet 6500A Plus"
3922558,B016XTRBIU,2,"I'm not going to complain because this ink is so cheap.  However, beware when you open them!  Take measures (lots of paper towels) to keep ink from going everywhere. So far they work just fine after clean up. BEWARE"
3922559,B016XTRBIU,5,"Was a little leary buying these for the price compared to the HP cartridges, but they have worked fantastic so far! Came in 2 days and have been printing pictures for a week now and they look fantastic! My HP printer brings up a warning that they are not the correct brand, but I just click OK and it prints everything without problems. Highly recommend, saved me $50!
So to update, I printed 50 save the dates and 50 wedding invites both with lots of color and details and they looked professionally done and beautiful! The cartridges lasted through all of that and then ran out of black after I printed 15 coloring book pages for my kiddos! Highly recommend, currently ordering more! Great!"
3922560,B016XTRBIU,5,"Works great, just like the manufactured HP cartridge. I could see purchasing the HP one if you wanted to ensure high quality prints.

My HP printer does say its not HP ink but it still works. All the colors come out great. It feels like the actual HP ink. I don't think i'll need to buy ink for a very long time.

3922575,B016XTRBIU,5,"This is my review from my first purchase.  I Immediately bought more, this larger assortment for just $1 more.  Here is my initial review....
Awesome product!!! In my initial feedback I said I would be purchasing more, and I did, for myself and my mother.  Ok, so I have been refilling cartridges at a local retail place, and that saved me money over genuine HP, but this.....even better!  In my case, the last couple of times I had had my color cartridges refilled I had trouble with them, thus I had been without color ink for a year, because I just could not see spending the money, like $50, to have it fail.  Then I saw MIROO on Amazon and thought for the price how could I go wrong.  I AM SO GLAD THAT I GAVE IT A TRY! For the price of getting one cartridge refilled, MIROO gave me a full set of black and color! I figured if just the black worked I could try and get my color working again after a year at no risk.  I put the cartridges in and IT PRINTED PERFECTLY FIRST TRY!!!  The next day I purchased another full set, this time the double black and full set of color for just $1 more. Really?  AWESOME!  Then a few days later I bought my mother ink for her printer 564XL and it worked wonderfully for her as well.  So you may ask ""Are they full?""  They are clear and they look full to me.  And besides, for in my case, 8% of genuine HP cost, how could they not be full enough to make it worth while.  But again they look filled up to me.  I am going to be printing way more freely with color now that MIROO has my back.  I rarely review.  Only when I am really impressed or not, do I take the time to give a review.  And in this case I AM VERY IMPRESSED with the quality and the price! I have now purchased 5 times and still loving it!  Great Product!"
3922576,B016XTRBIU,5,"Very nice, fast shipment. Price is fantastic. Impressive"
3922577,B016XTRBIU,4,I'm editing my review and giving 4 stars for this product. At first I was getting an HP message stating I was using the wrong ink cartridge but the seller sent me instructions on how to wipe the contacts and I've only got the message once since then. The ink looks just as good as HP and it seems to be lasting. I never get full output because I don't use my printer that often and the HP ink usually dries up before I can use it all so I won't be able to compare the output. I'm happy with the product and would buy it again. Their customer service is outstanding and would rate that alone as 5 stars. I get an error from HP every time the printer starts up saying that the ink is not HP which is annoying. Waiting to see how long
3922578,B016XTRBIU,5,Fast delivery and great prodct for the price. Great!
3922579,B016XTRBIU,1,"I seldom leave a negative review, but I feel the need for this ink cartridge. First off they are messy. The ink will leak on you, your printer, your carpet and more. Second, the factory XL ink lasts for a very long time, a few hundred pages of text at minimum. The black ink ran out in less than 50 pages. I  think most of the ink was wasted having to clean, the print head every few times using the printer. Save the trouble and DO NOT BUY"
3922580,B016XTRBIU,5,"Installation was a snap. Some reviewers cautioned to wear gloves because the install was messy, so I did but I didn't need them. All the cartridges are working fine, and the heavily discounted price was unbelievable. Still a bargain at twice the price. All the cartridges are working fine, and the heavily discounted price was unbelievable"

3922582,B016XTRBIU,4,"Ink got all over my hands, but it's printing well and was easy to install. My HP Office Jet 6500 is using is without any glitch. So much cheaper than other ink brands! Just be careful when you remove the orange tab so you don't get ink on your clothes. but it's printing well and was easy to install"
3922583,B016XTRBIU,4,"Ink worked without a problem in my HP printer, the Printer did complain about it not being an HP product but it worked fine. I agree with the other reviewers open the product over a sink and don't put your hand below the cartridge when you first open them or you will get ink on your hands Good for the price"
3922584,B016XTRBIU,5,Seems to be working great. Excellent price. Worth a try
3922586,B016XTRBIU,5,"I was running low on ink so i order 3 off brand ink sets in order to test them out and see which one i was going to keep for future use. So in order to test the ink I printed 2 pictures with HP ink and then i replaced the cartridges to the Miroo Ink set. Now just to be fair I printed  a couple of the same pictures with the new ink so that any of the HP ink was out of the feed lines, then I printed the same 2 pictures with the new ink. I do have to say that I didn't notice any differences I will post the pictures up and you tell me if you see any differences. I ran the same test on all 3 of the off brand ink sets and I do have to say that all were so close to the HP inks that I wouldn't mind ordering any of them. For the price this is definitely up there in my choices. The 3 inks I tested against the HP brand are the Miroo, the Jet Sir and the Office World. I would recommend any of these 3 sets and for the price I couldn't even tell the differences. For price and quality I choose Miroo over HP inks."

3922593,B016XTRBIU,4,"My wife installed the cartridges while I was away.  She said all went well except for the yellow one that leaked on her hand.  She followed the directions and installed the yellow just like the others.  The leaking cartridge seems to be a common theme with this product.  The printer seems to be working fine and the colors look good.  Time will tell how long they last.  So far these are a great value. Great value, wear gloves when installing unless you like colored fingers."

3922597,B016XTRBIU,5,"Don't over spend, these work  great for 7 times less Exceeded expectations"
3922598,B016XTRBIU,2,"The black cartridges are fairly trustworthy, although they occasionally stop printing.  This is generally a simple fix; just take the cartridge out, give it a good shake, and reinstall.  I'm willing to do that for the savings over the genuine HP cartridges.  The color cartridges, however, are a different story.  The first thing I noticed when I took the yellow cartridge out is that the 'ink' looked more like yellow-tinted water.  Same for the blue and magenta.  I tried to shake them well before installing, but it still looked like water.  I've given them a two week trial and so far every color has printed as varying shades of green.  (For reference, I've attached a picture of a spreadsheet I just tried to print.  The colors that were supposed to print are indicated.)

Amazon used to be pretty reliable for recycled ink cartridges, but this is the second company I've had problems with lately.  I think they've stopped even pretending to have quality standards for their Marketplace sellers.  My advice is to look for printer ink elsewhere- I certainly will. Reasonably Reliable Black Ink, Not So Much With the Colors"
3922599,B016XTRBIU,5,Great price. Replaced only the black ink so far and printed two schedules for work. Printed with quality. =]
3922600,B016XTRBIU,5,So far so good. Colors and operation better than my HP cartridges I took to Costco to refill.  2 weeks and flawless thus far.  For <$10 I don't see how you can go wrong with these.  Extremely pleased. So far so good. Colors and operation better than my HP cartridges ...
3922601,B016XTRBIU,5,Only the blue and black are any good . The yellow and magenta were dried up. Tried a new from them and it works great. I would buy this again. They have a good and inexpensive product and they stand behind it. They have a good produst.
3922602,B016XTRBIU,4,"My ink works great only had one issue, don't open it upside or it will leak. But one of my ink cartridges was ruined by that reason, it must have been put in the box upside down and leaked in the plastic package.

3922610,B016XTRBIU,5,"I was kind of skeptical when I bought this cartridges because I had never used any other brand of ink on my HP printer but I could not be any happier because I had exactly the same results that I get with original ink. So there is not really much to say that why not you get more ink for less money with the same results..I will be ordering more once I close to running out and I'm extremely happy with my purchase... I totally recommend this product.
**** I had images to share of the quality and results of this ink cartridges but I lost my camera... I will be posting some soon. Same quality for way less money."
3922611,B016XTRBIU,5,"Cannot recommend enough! I received my set and put them in my printer. Unfortunately, one of the cartridges had the chip positioned incorrectly, so the cartridge would not register and I had to place the old empty cartridge in to get my printer to work. I contacted the company and they promptly sent me out an entirely new set. I inserted that cartridge and it worked perfectly! Customer service was prompt and kind. Print quality is absolutely identical. I am very loyal when I find a generic ink cartridge manufacturer/seller. I WILL DEFINITELY be purchasing from them for all my ink needs! Great Customer Service, Great Product!"

3922646,B016XTRBIU,5,"Just like many of the reviews stated the only problem with these cartridges is that they leak when opening and installing. I wore plastic gloves over my sink and they all leaked. Despite my gloves I still got ink on my thumb that has been very hard to remove. In fact, my thumb nail after much cleaning days later is still stained. When I installed them I took the advice of overs and cleaned my print heads after installing (twice). I also printed a couple test pages which appeared too wet with ink on the first printing. After the cartridges worked beautifully. For the price difference I am willing to chance get my hands inky. Great product and outstanding price with some installation challenges."

My HP printer always throws fits about refilled cartridges ( I refill my own), and I have to do head cleaning runs on it, I think perhaps they are now programmed to give fits when refills are used, but thats just my guess. These are a very very low cost alternative to new ones, and only a little more than refilling, so will continue to use them. Great low cost alternative, work fine"

Ran test prints, cartridge alignment, and made several color copies, and all is ok.  Nice that the cartridges have a clear window in the ink reservoir, so you can actually look and see how much is left.  I may amend this review in a couple of months, if there are any problems after long-term use. Messy, but work"

3922674,B016XTRBIU,5,"So far so good. Some things print slightly off color (slightly darker or lighter, but in the same color family and not incredibly noticeable), but I've had no real issues with this ink to date.

I read some reviews stating that it can splatter when opening. because I was aware of this possibility, I actually opened them very carefully inside of a plastic bag, that way if there was any splattering it would be contained to the inside of the bag. I did not have any issues with this, but there was some ink at the very top of the...well, I'm not sure what it's called, but the part that clicks into the printer to distribute the ink (the well, maybe?) Anyway, based on the loose ink at the top where you open it, I could see how things could get messy if you're not expecting it.

The first cartridge I used was not recognized by my printer as an off-brand cartridge, but the second one was. Using off-brand cartridges voids your warranty, but my printer is already out of warranty, so that wasn't an issue for me.

All in all, based on the huge savings you get compared to the HP brand replacement cartridges, I'd use these again. Will update if any serious SNAFUs occur. Serious bang for your buck if your printer's warranty is already voided/you don't care about voiding it."

I am one to do some research on products before I decide to make a purchase and in reading some of the reviews I was hesitant to place an order but I also needed to find a way to cut the outrageous cost of more HP ink so I gave it a try.

The ink came individually wrapped in plastic and boxed perfectly.  And as I mentioned I had read some of the reviews that shared issues when the caps were removed so I used an absorbent pad and disposable gloves before I worked the caps off but to my surprise I had no problems what so ever.  I love the visibility of the cartridges in that you are able to see the ink level and there won't be any questions as to how much ink is left or will I have enough ink to print up my entire project?  And let me tell you all the 4 cartridges were filled to the top.

Loading them into my printer was a snap, they fit just like the original HP ink. Once loaded my printer flashed the non HP cartridge alert but pushing the ""OK"" button dealt with it.  Before making any prints I used the head cleaner function on my printer then ran a test page.  And I was surprisingly impressed with the color quality, the blue and yellow really popped as compared to what I was getting from my old cartridges.  It may have been due to dirty heads but I always clean the them when I replace the cartridges, either way I'm getting color like I hadn't before.

3922706,B016XTRBIU,5,"As other reviewers have said, some of the cartridges are VERY full.  I recommend opening them over a sink or some easily cleanable/disposable surface and wiping away the excess ink.  Once you are aware of this attribute of the cartridges, though, it is really a non-issue.  I find it hard to complain about a company filling an ink cartridge to capacity.

I installed the cartridges into a disused HP Officejet 6500 printer (I bought a laser and stopped using inkjets due to the outrageously high cost of replacement ink), and the printing output color was quite poor.  After a few iterations of print head cleaning, though, the print quality became as good as it has ever been.  It turns out that the print head was dirty/clogged where the cyan comes out.

Now I have nothing but good things to say about the cartridges.  When I contacted Smartjet (the seller), and reported my findings:

""The black and magenta seem to be perfect.  The yellow is quite
faded compared to the black and magenta.  The cyan is mostly dead on
arrival, as it barely works at all.""

I got a response offering to replace the cyan and yellow cartridges (no explicit offer to pay shipping, but it was implied).  I then cleaned the print head, and everything was fine.  But the customer service response was fast and polite, without even a hesitation to replace the product that I reported as possibly defective.  For that, I would have given high marks even if the cartridges had actually been defective.

I have every intention of buying another set  when these run out.  The price is fantastic, the quality is on par with HP, and Smartjet seems to stand behind their products. Very Happy Customer"
3922707,B016XTRBIU,5,Great product with excellent performance and you can't beat the price.  Works without a problem with our HP OfficeJet 6500A.  Just purchased another set! Excellent performance.
3922708,B016XTRBIU,5,I was very happy with this purchase. The price is unbeatable and the cartridge works perfect. I used one day shipping and I was very surprised when my package arrived next day morning....I will definitely buy from this seller again...... I was very happy with this purchase
3922709,B016XTRBIU,5,My HP recognized these cartridges and they seem to with very well. Inexpensive ink
3922710,B016XTRBIU,4,I just installed the cartidges and with a little work...running a head cleaning program. the cartridges work great.  I was a little skeptical about buying and off brand for the HP printer so just in case I bought the brand HP as well just as a back up. None the less I will not buy HP again as long as this brand is available the cartridges work great. I was a little skeptical about buying and ...
3922711,B016XTRBIU,5,"I have purchased 4 sets of these, and they work a thousand times better than the actual HP ink cartridges. I only had one that had a bad clip on it, and it still managed to work fantastic. I am going to keep buying these until the printer itself gives out! A+ from me! Well worth it! This is one generic cartridge I will be more than glad to recommend!"
3922712,B016XTRBIU,5,These ink cartridges work great! I just put one in and had no issues with a non hp mfg cartridge. And at such a cost saving! Loving it. Great product at a huge savings.
3922713,B016XTRBIU,1,"Well, we took the risk with the off-brand. Completely useless in our HP Officejet 6500. The printer recognized the cartridges as not an HP product. I pressed ""OK"" hoping they would still work. The next message was that the printer head is damaged or removed. After several restarts and attempts to reseat the cartridges, I had to give up. For $10 it was worth a shot, but the frustration will keep me from a second try. Price is tempting until the disappointment sets in"
3922714,B016XTRBIU,4,"the printer kept saying they couldn't find them or they were ""damaged"". WhenI cleaned the heads and ran the page print, all things are working fine. I'm glad that they are cheaper and function just as well as the HP cartridges. I'm sold. all things are working fine. I'm glad that they are cheaper and function ..."
3922715,B016XTRBIU,4,"The price could be better but it's better than buying genuine ones.  My printer, though this cartridge is working just fine, gives me a message every time I turn it on which could be annoying for some. Sort of leaked when I peeled seals but didn't really do any damage to my print-outs.  The shipping was fast. This one works for my printer."
3922716,B016XTRBIU,5,"Great product for a great price. Read instructions when installing, you will get a little ink on your hands. Will buy again. Great product for a great price"
3922718,B016XTRBIU,5,"Today I am reviewing the MIROO 4 Pack High Capacity Replacement for HP 920 ink Cartridge Compatible with HP Officejet 6500 6000 7000 7500 printer.  I always read reviews on products before I buy them.  Especially when trying non OEM ink for my HP printer as I have never done this before.  They cartridges were very easy to open and install.  I have an HP 6500 and the ink fits and works just great.  These cartridges are just as good as the HP ink for a lot less of the price for HP ink.  After printing you cannot even tell if you are using HP ink or this wonderful product.  When this ink runs out I will definitely purchase this product again.  I will never buy overpriced HP ink again.  I recommend this product to everyone.  I will be buying this product for all of my family and friends with HP printers.  I had no idea that non OEM ink would work as great if not better then OEM ink.  What would you rather do?  Pay $10 for this product that works perfectly?  Or spend $80 for HP ink that works just the same?  That is a no brainer to me.

Disclaimer:  I received this product for free or at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review.  The price I paid for this product bears no weight at all on my opinion of this product.  The opinions expressed are my own.  I take my reviews seriously and rate them accordingly.  [...]Thank you for reading my review. Never buy OEM ink again"
3922719,B016XTRBIU,5,"To save money I purchased these cartridges, they work great.  Thank  you they work great. Thank"
3922720,B016XTRBIU,5,These work absolutely fine and for a fraction of the cost of HP.  My HP printer let me know these weren't real HP ink cartridges.  OK.  I clicked twice and am able to check ink levels.  I am very happy with these and cannot deal when the ink prices of real HP ink is so high.  So glad these are available. Work Absolutely Fine!
3922721,B016XTRBIU,5,"Work great, installed and bingo, no problems. Totally satisfied and thrilled at the price. Five Stars"
3922722,B016XTRBIU,5,"This replacement ink seems fine.  I had no spill or stain issues as others reviews have mentioned. My printer has issues so I am not sure in the long run that this non brand ink is perfect or not.  Until my printer dies (any day now), the Miroo 4 seems great. This replacement ink seems fine.

3922728,B016XTRBIU,5,The cartridges worked perfectly in my HP Officejet 7000 Wide Format Printer.  I did not experience any of the rejection messages noted in other reviews.

3922729,B016XTRBIU,5,"Cartridges fit perfectly in my printer. Did a test page and coloring looks great. Great customer service. Had an issue with the package when It was delievered-one of the black cartridges somehow leaked inside the box. I had already received an email from Alice asking if I was happy with the purchase so I responded with my issue. She apologized and shipped out a replacement to me for free. For the price and customer service, I'd definitely buy these from this seller again. Cheap price, just as good as HP and great customer care"

3922732,B016XTRBIU,4,"I first purchased this product on March 11, 2016. The cartridges worked fine except for the YELLOW cartridge. No ink came out of it at all.

3922735,B016XTRBIU,5,"excellent price and worked perfectly the first time.  i'll also note the cartridge is clear so you can see the ink levels which I really appreciate.  my printer recognized them as non-HP, but was able to give accurate levels, something that doesn't happen with all replacement cartridges. found the perfect ink finally"
3922736,B016XTRBIU,5,Ink came on time and as described. Ink has been great so far- no problems at all. Good product for a good price.

3922738,B016XTRBIU,5,Had an issue with the yellow cartridge not working but their customer service responded the next day and shipped a whole new pack (with all ink)..  Had no issue with the replacement. Had an issue but they fixed it promptly!!!
3922739,B016XTRBIU,5,"UPDATED:
Finally got my new print head from a different vendor and am very pleased with the print cartridges.

They work great, although they do come up as Non HP Supplies, but they still work.

Can't beat the price, I get so tired of spending nearly the cost of a new printer for cartridges, this is an excellent deal in comparison.

Delivery was quick, I will most definitely reorder this product.

Please try and make a combo available that includes the print head?  I had to wait 2 weeks for a print head on a slow boat from China. I like the price"

3922745,B016XTRBIU,5,"Great cartridges, but my HP doesn't recognize them.  That's my fault, not the sellers.  I have to restart the printer and select ""yes, I'm aware that these aren't HP""  lol
Fast shipping, properly packaged Great cartridges, but my HP doesn't recognize them"
3922746,B016XTRBIU,5,fast service - works great for my needs - I will irder again! Works great for my needs!
3922747,B016XTRBIU,4,"Great price compared to the name brand.  The color inks worked great and with no trouble, but the black ink won't produce anything on the paper.  It's possible it's my printer that's having trouble, but I'm not sure (I've tried two blacks from this company, but haven't tried going back to HP for the black ink to see if that's the problem) Nice alternative to name brand ink"
3922748,B016XTRBIU,5,I replaced my printhead with a refurbished one and installed these and everything works well. I've had this HP 6500 for about eight years and have been spending +-$90 for the HP equivalent so for this price I will be using these and keep this great All-In-One ticking!!! The inks look as vivid as the HP's. I've had this HP 6500 for about eight years and have been spending +-$90 for the HP equivalent so for this price I will be using
3922749,B016XTRBIU,5,"I am very impressed with these printer cartridges. I decided to give it a try because of the price point but didn't have high expectations. They work great with no issues. I will no longer buy expensive branded printer ink and only purchase this printer ink. High quality, low price"
3922750,B016XTRBIU,1,"The cartridges leaked and, after one copy, no longer generated quality prints One Star"
3922751,B016XTRBIU,1,"Do not buy this product. my printer does not recognize the cartridges and I just spent a lot of money on several packs. Do yourself a favor and buy the legitimate HP-branded product.

I'd like the compant to give me a refund. Very deceiving. Do not buy! Printer doesn't recognize cartridges!"
3922752,B016XTRBIU,5,Works as well as HP for much less money. Was concerned about print quality but copies are as sharp as units costing quadruple the cost. Whoo Hoo MIroo!!!
3922753,B016XTRBIU,4,"I used the black ink cartridge so far, works very well. We run through a cartridge in a month, for the price this is great. Packing and delivery were like the real cartridge from HP. No issues. Great product at great price."
3922754,B016XTRBIU,4,"I like the cost, but it is not printing well from the very beginning. It may have printed correctly 1-2 times but after that, it has not printed with very good quality. I like the cost"
3922755,B016XTRBIU,5,no problem in using.  nice the printer shows the level. some other refills do not have this feature. nice the printer shows the ink level

3922759,B016XTRBIU,5,"You would think all the warnings being given from my printer would have resulted in the printer exploding in a ball of flame when I started using generic ink cartridges. Well, it didn't happen and my printer seems to be working absolute fine with these replacement ink cartridges.  Consider buying generic to save MUCH money.  I will continue to do so. No Flames, Explosions, only a LOT of Money Saved"
3922760,B016XTRBIU,5,"So far, so good! Only opened the blue, but it inserted properly and the printer even recognized the cartridge! No problems so far!"

3922764,B016XTRBIU,1,"After pondering over paying the usual $50 + dollars I spend on 4 cartridges for my old HP 6000 Ink Jet, I decided to try the Brand X (Miroo 4-Pack).  I'd heard many people say it works just as well.  Well it did....for the first document I printed with a colored panel banner heading.  It was perfect and I was rejoicing.  Then a few days later I printed another document and the color ran and no black ink at all.  Then I go into my HP preferences and the little message came up that device had detected the use of non-Hewlett Package ink cartridges. It's like it printed okay the first time, but once it got the message....the party was over.  I proceeded to do a diagnostic; cleaned the heads, the whole 9-yards.  Still nothing! Anyone know if there is a way of straightening this out?  Regardless I  then was totally discouraged so I went out and bought the genuine HP brand name cartridges for $60 + AND IT STILL DOESN'T WORK. Blurred color -  No black ink will print at all.  My son just bought me a new printer. So much for cartridges and Hewlett Packard. IT DIDN'T WORK FOR ME"
3922765,B016XTRBIU,5,"My printer is out of warranty, therefore using off-brand cartridges is not an issue. I handled the cartridges carefully so there was no mess, and they fit nicely into the printer. Print quality so far is great. and they fit nicely into the printer"
3922766,B016XTRBIU,5,"Color ink is a luxury in education.  This product is high quality for a great price, the students love that we have a color printer that they can use.  Than you for this product and the great service! Happy Teacher!"
3922767,B016XTRBIU,4,The cartridge tested out ok I don't know how long the quality of the ink will last because this is my first time using it Cartridge Review
3922768,B016XTRBIU,5,"Usually buying printer ink is very expensive, however, I was lucky enough to stumble upon this Miroo 4 pack of printer ink that is compatible with my printer. It came nicely packaged, directions were helpful, and the other reviews were supportive of this product. For the amount of printing I do, this product is ideal and exceeded my expectations. I don't think you could ask for a better product. Printer ink."
3922769,B016XTRBIU,5,Worked like charm. Instructions suggest using gloves when installing. I'll order back up ink again. Delivers as promised
3922770,B016XTRBIU,5,A great alternative to the over-priced name brand Would Buy Again
3922771,B016XTRBIU,5,"Like others have mentioned, these leak when you are first opening/installing them.  I suggest wearing gloves to avoid the rainbow-colored hands I had for 2 days afterward.  :)  Still, a small price to pay for printing that looks exactly like that of the name-brand cartridge at a tiny fraction of the price. Work great, leaky when installing"
3922772,B016XTRBIU,5,"This was our second ink purchase from MIROO. The ink works great, same as HP. I cannot tell the difference. The seller is quick and courteous. You save money. What's not to love? The ink works great, same as HP"
3922773,B016XTRBIU,4,"So far so good with your ink products; I rated 4 stars because I paid a higher price for these that what I had been using, but if these last better then I will be glad for the change and the price will be worth it. So far so good with your ink products"
3922774,B016XTRBIU,5,Incredible value with the two XL black ink cartridges. The colors came in handy too. Ink quality looks the same as HP brand. I'll definitely continue to use these replacements in the future. Good So Far
3922775,B016XTRBIU,5,"Wow, what a great price for replacement ink for my HP 6500 series printer. Product was delivered promptly and packaged properly. Each color ink was individually sealed and very easy to install. If you have replaced ink on your printer before it is the same exact process with these.

Once installed the printer notifies you that non hp ink has been installed, click ok and you are good. Did a print test page and everything looked good. You might want to do clean print head option if your printer has that to make sure printer is good and not the ink is a problem.

The prices that hp charges for ink is crazy. These work just fine and save you a lot of money. I Received the Product at Discount or For Free. Great savings for quality replacement ink"
3922776,B016XTRBIU,5,"What a bargain!  I have to do a lot of printing, and get so many more pages from these cartridges.  The pages I print out are exceptional quality, and I print on economical settings, using black ink only.  I know I have printed off many, many more pages than with HP ink cartridges.  I have printed a couple of pictures, and they are very good.  Not as bright as other name brand inks, but it works for me, especially at this price. Great product. Miroo ink cartridges"
3922777,B016XTRBIU,2,The black ink ran all over the place Two Stars
3922778,B016XTRBIU,5,They do work perfect with my HP6500 Great product
3922779,B016XTRBIU,5,"Works great! At first it looked streaky, but then I figured out there was another strip I needed to peel away. After I did that, it worked like a charm. Two areas to pull off before using"
3922780,B016XTRBIU,5,A lot cheaper then HP and I don't see any difference. Five Stars
3922781,B016XTRBIU,5,Loaded magenta only at this time. No problems. Printing quality improved. Real value here. Real value. Quality printing.

3922783,B016XTRBIU,5,Good product.  Great color.  Only caution is to be careful when first opening as sometimes a little ink will spill out.  Saved a ton over brand name ink! Great Value

3922788,B016XTRBIU,5,"Great Price. Exactly what I hoped to receive. HP printers are picky and whenever you use non-HP replacements, I recommend running ""Clean Print Head"" tool. Everything works great!! Great Price. Exactly what I hoped to receive"
3922789,B016XTRBIU,5,so far working good not having any problems. don't print a lot so waiting to see how long they last. But so far I'm Happy so far working good not having any problems
3922790,B016XTRBIU,4,"Because of the high quality of colors and also because my Laserjet  HP printer (old one), registered the levels of the ink, which is very important for me. Very good quality Vs. Prices"
3922791,B016XTRBIU,4,so far so good. Four Stars
3922792,B016XTRBIU,4,"Great logo! That aside, the order was sent quickly, packaged effectively, and so far the ink is working just fine (even though my hp printer likes to tell me that non-hp ink cartridges have been installed). Great logo! That aside"
3922794,B016XTRBIU,2,"Like many of the concerns people have with generic you run the risk like I did.  I followed all the directions with precautions of the gloves to avoid leaking, holding them upside down, etc.  No issues with the installing process, but getting them to work was the challenge.  I installed all 4 cartridges and my HP6500 was able to detect that they were no genuine HP ink.  No big deal.  I then allowed the printer to run through the preparation cycle.  After a few minutes I tried to print something and it did not print good at all.  So I performed the cleaning of the printer-head and aligning the cartridges through the printer features.  I noticed that the test paper was only printing black and a light haze of yellow. I thin printed a document and bingo the black cartridge worked.  So I then wanted to print a regular color copy and discovered that it still was not working.  I performed the printer-head cleaning and aligning about three times and still no test page that showed other colors.  The only color that worked was black.  I removed the 3 color cartridges re installed my original 3 HP color ones.  Went to print and every thing was fine.  So I guess for the $10.00 dollars I spent I did get a 920XL black cartridge out of it.  I was totally hoping that the other three worked, but it wasn't a total loss.

So far I have had no issues what so ever. The inks work great and are much cheaper than the $30-$40 alternatives. Would definitely recommend this product! Skeptical but surprised..."
3922798,B016XTRBIU,5,"My advice to those who have had ink come out-- pull the tape first.  I installed these, got the 'non-HP' message, clicked okay, then printed a test page.  Not too bad.  Aligned the heads via HP Solution Center and voila!

Really, really nice.

My only regret is that I'd purchased liquid ink before and won't use it anymore.  I don't mind paying for quality, but HP, IMHO, is trying to make fools of us all with what they charge. Good, really!"

3922809,B016XTRBIU,1,"At first my HP 6500A would not print with these cartridges because they aren't OEM. The trick was to get the printer to print a test page at which point it forgot about complaining and went to work. After that they're working fine.

*Update*
After a software update the above trick no longer works. Also bumping this review down to 1 star because the seller will not stop emailing me asking me to take down this review. Works with a trick"
3922810,B016XTRBIU,5,"Best bang for the buck! The printer recognizes that they aren't HP cartridges, but they work just fine. These cartridges work!"

3922815,B016XTRBIU,4,"At the beginning I thought it wasn't working but just be sure to clip it in properly and your printer will tell you it is not an HP ink but over all an absolute great product for the price!! Stop wasting your money on the HP ink and try something new and cheaper. Defs a good buy, also I would like to note that the ink did NOT spill out and wasn't messy Amazingly cheap and great!"

3922825,B016XTRBIU,1,"Snapped right into my printer like real HP cartridges. They didn't leak or ""spill"" like so many others experienced.

UPDATE: I used this product for about 6 months. I should have paid attention to the warnings that they work for a while and then jam up the ink carriage. Now I have an ink carrier error and have had no luck correcting it no matter how many times I tried the troubleshooting tips online and available by HP. Should have just stuck with HP products. I just bought a new printer to replace the one that may have been fine if I had used real HP replacement cartridges in the first place.

UPDATE 4/28/17: The seller refunded. Thank you. Good at first but ruins the printer"
3922826,B016XTRBIU,1,This item is not compatible with my printer but it's the size my printer takes so what's the problem Ink not the size

 Ink gives great results with my fussy HP printer.
Nice bright colors and good flow for Head print patterns.
I Recommend this vendor. Great Vendor!"
3922837,B016XTRBIU,4,"This high capacity replacement for my HP printer is so much cheaper that buying from a brick and mortar store. The product works well, the only issue I have is that the black ink cartridge needs to be reseeding every time I turn on the printer. I guess a small price to pay for cheap ink. Cheap Ink Replacement"
3922838,B016XTRBIU,5,"Yellow ink leaked a bit, but had a paper towel ready. Print jobs are  perfect no smears or leaking once installed. Print jobs are perfect no smears or leaking once installed"
3922839,B016XTRBIU,5,"Arrived on time, easy to install, and the ink looks great when printed. I bought to use on printed labels and they came out great! Everything I expected and more"
3922840,B016XTRBIU,1,"One cartridge wouldn't fit well in the printer, not allowing it to print at all.  (I had to reinstall my old cartridge.)  It also leaked while trying to put it in. I guess you get what you pay for."
3922841,B016XTRBIU,5,"I can't tell a difference between these and HP official ink, definitely worth it. Great Quality, Great Price!"
3922843,B016XTRBIU,5,I have only used the black so far but will be switching out the others soon. The black worked fine and the packaging and shipping was as promised. Time will tell if the color is good and the capacity is as stated. The black worked fine and the packaging and shipping was as promised

3922845,B016XTRBIU,5,I have used at least two of each of the three color cartridges and found they provided quite a bit of printing with very good quality. Good Quality Long Lasting Cartridges
3922846,B016XTRBIU,5,Great quality product at an absolutely rock bottom price!!! High quality low price!!!
3922847,B016XTRBIU,4,"I have used the blue and magenta so far and they work just fine.  As with other reviews, the ink does ""dribble"" a little when first opened, but it isn't a huge problem.  I have purchased other compatibles before and to be frank, these have performed the best in my way of thinking.  I will use MIROO again for sure. Not Perfect But Very Good"
3922848,B016XTRBIU,5,"Great product, unbelievable prices. What's NOT to like!!! unbelievable prices!"
3922849,B016XTRBIU,5,"Perfect!  Amazing price, printer reads ink levels, didn't have to clean the print head, just works perfect.  Amazing price too!  It is crazy to spend $60.00 to buy ink from HP.  Don't understand the other reviews about leaking cartridges, they all look first quality to me and installed easily, no problems at all. Don't hesitate, buy these!"
3922850,B016XTRBIU,5,Worked perfectly on both my hp 6980 and hp 6500 wireless. No installation problems. Ink levels were indicated on both. Worked perfectly on both my hp 6980 and hp 6500 ...

3922854,B016XTRBIU,4,"3 of the four ink cartons worked.  But the Yellow for some reason would not be accepted by my printer. I ended up having to buy a separate yellow carton just to get my printer to work again.
They had to mail me replacements for the yellow to work. Eh"
3922855,B016XTRBIU,5,Was exactly what I needed and worked perfectly Five Stars
3922856,B016XTRBIU,5,Extremely satisfied with this. Great price also. Affordable Inks
3922865,B016XTRBIU,5,The ink is working out great!  And the price was amazing! Good purchase
3922866,B016XTRBIU,4,"I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this brand. I am surprised at how well they worked. The only problem I had was, when I loaded the cartridges I had to load it two and three times to get the printer to accept it. I am genuinely happy with this product. Hope to see the three color cartridges packed in larger package without black in the future. I am genuinely happy with this product"
3922867,B016XTRBIU,5,I was hesitant at first because of the cheap cost. But I'm glad that I went with this product. The quality is just as great as named brand ink! Great price Great ink
3922869,B016XTRBIU,5,Good product at a good price. So far it works just like the high dollar brand name. 4 pack ink

3922871,B016XTRBIU,5,Excellent for plain paper printing. Not sure about photo printing because I have another printer for that purpose. Five Stars
3922872,B016XTRBIU,5,"I was not sure how these would work but after putting the cartridges into the printer I did have to do a print head cleaning and after that the worked great, I would definitly purchase these again you can't beat the price! Great Value Ink Cartridges"
3922873,B016XTRBIU,5,
3922874,B016XTRBIU,5,These are very good and best replacement for the OEM. Saves tons of money. Best replacement for OEM
3922875,B016XTRBIU,5,"Works great even better than original HP inks. Fast shipping, good package and good quality."
3922876,B016XTRBIU,5,It is nice to purchase ink for such a lower price .  Copies are looking great and I will definitely reorder this product.  I am so glad to finally be able to purchase ink that does not cost the price of a new printer.  Thank You!! It is nice to purchase ink for such a lower price
3922877,B016XTRBIU,5,"The only cartridges I've found this far that accurately display ink status, a big plus.

Additionally, one of the cyan cartridges arrived with no chip installed, so the printer would not recognize it. I contacted customer support and they took care of it right away. They asked me to send a photo of the missing chip on the cartridge and they went ahead and sent out a replacement.

This was all taken care of by Alice, who is very prompt and got everything squared away immediately.

Fair and reasonably-priced. A great choice. A great choice."
3922878,B016XTRBIU,1,a cartridge lasted 2 weeks! One Star
3922880,B016XTRBIU,5,"Ink cartridges work perfectly, and arrived quickly.  Great price! Great price and ink cartridges work well!"
3922881,B016XTRBIU,5,"This was my first time trying replacement ink for my HP All-in-One that was not from the manufacturer. The product worked great, cost me less than $10.00 and was delivered on time. Awesomely Surprised"
3922882,B016XTRBIU,5,My HP Officejet 6500 is very happy with a stomach full of all the colors it did not have. It is all working fantastic. What a great price as well. I will be purchasing more in the near future to always have some backup. My HP Officejet 6500 is very happy with a stomach full of all the colors it ...
3922883,B016XTRBIU,4,"Little tight on the fit, but they work. I have been using them for a few weeks now and no issues.  Ink looks good. Ink looks good."

3922895,B016XTRBIU,5,C@me on time and they worked correctly. Thank u
3922896,B016XTRBIU,5,they work great and also show correct balance of ink in the cartridges. excellent product
3922897,B016XTRBIU,5,"This product really fit the bill. I did not see any difference with the black ink at all and I don't see why I would spend 10 times as much to get the HP brand...so next time will definitely be getting this product again. I did see some difference in the the color printing, which seemed to have a significant magenta tint to it, but for me this was not a deal breaker since for me those color cartridges were a bonus. Great product, great value"
3922898,B016XTRBIU,5,"So far, I have only used the cyan cartridge. Color seems accurate, printing seems to be good quality. The only annoyance is the HP warning that a non-HP cartridge is detected in the printer. That's not MIROO's problem, it's HP's. printing seems to be good quality. The only annoyance is the HP warning ..."
3922899,B016XTRBIU,5,great price and work perfectly..replaced all 4 at once they started right up great product and service
3922900,B016XTRBIU,1,I was not satisfied. The cartridges were not compatible with my HP printer. Not compatible
3922901,B016XTRBIU,5,"I was definitely skeptical of generic ink cartridges, but I figured for $9 and with 5 stars it was worth a shot instead of spending $70+. They look just like real HP cartridges except clear. I popped them in, and printed a small picture in color. They worked just fine. I didn't even bother aligning the cartridges or cleaning them with the printer utility. I'll do it if I feel like I need to. I am definitely going to be ordering these from now on! Just like the real thing"
3922902,B016XTRBIU,1,"It worked very well for the first 2 pages. This ink leaked and destroyed my $200 printer. Guess what? I can't do anything about it because these aren't made by hp. It's my fault for buying this product. I trusted your product and as a student, I tried saving money but I ended up having to buy another printer. As a conclusion to this story, don't buy this. Buying this ink is a gamble. It might work for some and might not for others. All 4 ink cartridges leaked! Not 1 but 4! I inspected them prior to installing and they were not leaking at all. Thanks for letting me print 2 pages tho! I'd rather spend the extra money to avoid this! It worked very well for the first 2 pages. ..."
3922903,B016XTRBIU,4,"so far working well. some leakage at opening but none since, I don't think. Four Stars"
3922904,B016XTRBIU,4,"Having bought other non-HP cartridges, I decided to try a package of Miroo color and black cartridges from Smartjet given that the price was extremely reasonable.  Once installed, even though my HP recognized the cartridges as non-HP, there was no problem printing and the output looked as good as that from HP cartridges.  I am only giving the product 4 stars because, after three weeks  of use, one of the cartridges stopped printing as a result of it no longer being seated firmly in the printer; apparently the plastic arm at the end of the cartridge no longer provided sufficient tension to keep it in its slot.  I am pleased to say that once I informed customer service of the problem, I was quickly provided with a complete replacement of my entire order at no charge.  I couldn't ask for any better service than what I was provided and will definitely buy from Smartjet again. Good cartridges and even better customer service"
3922905,B016XTRBIU,5,"Great Price and works as expected.  I hate having to pay full price for a certified OEM inkjet cartridge.  I used to refill my own inkjet cartridges but a few mishaps and mistakes created more mess and hassle than what I was savings.  Then I find MIROO cartridges. I admit I wasn't expecting much since the price was so low compared to the competition, but I was very pliantly surprised with how well these cartridges print and the print and color quality are just as good as the OEM.  Thanks! Way Better than I expected !"
3922906,B016XTRBIU,5,Ink works great snd I saved over $30 using this brand. Will be using this from now on!! Works great & great price!

3922909,B016XTRBIU,5,"Great deal for all Hp ink jet printer owners! Comes filled to the brim with clear case so you can see how much ink is left. I have a hp 6500 office jet. Just be careful when uncapping during installation. Great product, Super value!"

3922912,B016XTRBIU,2,I ordered them for my son and he said that one of them leaked all over the place. I told him to send them back or to let you all know but he must not have. He's in college so I don't have them here at home to send the product back and I don't believe he's had time to send them back. Thanks! I ordered them for my son and he said that ...
3922913,B016XTRBIU,1,These fit but would not be accepted by the HP printer. Had to throw them away...were also leaking. Would not buy these again :-( These fit but would not be accepted by the HP ...
3922914,B016XTRBIU,5,"hAVEN'T USED IT YET.  wILL be amazed if it works, considering the difference in price to the real thing.  Butt, the price difference was so I great, I just had to try it.  Can't wait til' my current ink runs out! wILL be amazed if it works"

3922919,B016XTRBIU,5,Awesome product! Paid so much more for original ones before... wish i tried it sooner! Now generic is my choice! don't see any difference in printing so why to pay more!) Nice and cheap price!!!

3922922,B016XTRBIU,5,"Finally had the opportunity to try this out.  So far, only tried the black ink.  No leaking of ink when I first unsealed the cartridge (unlike some other bargain brands).  Very snug fit into my printer, but my Office Jet accepted it with no issues and the ink is printing just fine.  So far, so good.  Have not used the color cartridges yet, but I expect those will be fine as well. but my Office Jet accepted it with no issues and the ink is printing just fine. So far"

3922927,B016XTRBIU,5,Very good product. Never buy HP ink again! Five Stars
3922928,B016XTRBIU,5,I have ordered this twice.  The first time the black cartridge had trouble snapping in and the small chip that ids it was louse in the bag.  This was easily worked around.  After I ran out again I ordered again.  This time was a fail.  The Black snapped in just fine but horrible print quality.  I will have to toss it.  The CYM cartridges are fine.  Update:  I was contacted by the sealer who sent me a new set free of charge.  The new set worked great!  Moving from 3 starts to a 5 and I will re order these again Hit or miss.
3922929,B016XTRBIU,5,Super...I will be ordering more and telling my friends..Great deal ! Five Stars
3922930,B016XTRBIU,4,"I took a shot with generic ink and ordered this - I figured the price was low enough that if it didn't work, I wouldn't be too upset.

Be careful, the cartridges come very full and if you aren't careful they can leak (sorry, carpet). I was dismayed to find the black one, for some reason, did not actually fit into my HP Officejet 6500... it was slightly too small and didn't ""click"" in.

I figured I'd head down to Costco and buy and buy genuine ink cartridge but I've gotten a couple of generic emails from the company asking if I was satisfied and if I would post a review. On a lark I replied to one email (not thinking that anyone would write back) and said I didn't plan on posting a review since the black ink didn't work. To my surprise they responded within a day, apologized, and offered to send me a new 4-pack of ink (even though I only said the black was a problem). This time the cartridge snapped in and I'm good to go. The printer is working fine and kudos to the company for their proactive customer service. Second time it worked"
3922931,B016XTRBIU,5,works perfect ...printer says that its non hp ink. but it works just fine perfect
3922932,B016XTRBIU,5,worked great Five Stars
3922933,B016XTRBIU,5,"I was looking for a cheaper solution to buying the HP cartridges from stores and this seems to be a great alternative.  Ive never purchased off-brand cartridges and was a little skeptical.  All of the other reviews were correct, it could be a little tricky to get the cartridges to fit at times.  Also, my hp printer made a fuss before accepting it.  I had an error message but after cleaning the print-heads (repeatedly), the error messages went away. Great product, once you can get the error messages to go away!"
3922934,B016XTRBIU,4,So far these are working great for a fraction of the price of name brand cartridges!!!! Four Stars
3922935,B016XTRBIU,5,Great product and great value. Will purchase again. Great customer service too. Great product

3922938,B016XTRBIU,5,"I have been using the Ink for a few days now, and I am quite pleased with it.  The HP 6500 printer recognized the cartridges, and they give good, though not perfect results when printing photos, I found that reducing the red color channel by 5% in Lightroom fixed all my issues.  For the price, you can't beat it. and I am quite pleased with it"
3922939,B016XTRBIU,5,"This ink is perfect if you're printing out documentation. It is not the best if you want to print photos however, it works perfectly for papers, graphs, Etc. I've been buying for over 2 years"
3922940,B016XTRBIU,5,I am in College and have a daughter in high school and son is middle school so we go through a lot ink. I got sick of paying so much for ink. So when I found this ink for so inexpensive I had to try it. We love it. It pro rd the same way and looks great we will never buy the expensive ink again. Love it.
3922941,B016XTRBIU,4,this is a follow up review...I received my first product and it didn't work so well. After a negative post I was contacted by the company and subsequently received a replacement.  Printer cartridge replacement is working much better! Worth the money!
3922942,B016XTRBIU,4,"Good value for mone, the yellow cartridge out of the package showed that it is partially full. Four Stars"

3922946,B016XTRBIU,5,"WIll buy again! Great seller, am very happy with the quality of the print outs, no different than OEM HP GREAT value here!"
3922947,B016XTRBIU,5,Great product with a great price.  The service was fantastic. This is the only place I buy my ink from. Great product
3922948,B016XTRBIU,1,"I ordered three black 920 (supposedly) HP compatible cartridges. One leaked during shipment (packaging looked fine.) Each of the other two dripped ink when the cover was removed for printer insertion. I had to blot them dry before loading into the printer. Then, neither of them fit properly in my HP 6500A printer so they were incompatible and did not work.  A complete waste of money. Not recommended"

Communication from seller in thanks was appreciated as well. and best of all"
3922958,B016XTRBIU,4,"Bought them for HP7500. Printer won't recognize them and they dripped ink when I opened them. My fingers have ink and almost messed up our new carpet!
Additional information:
The seller was very good at following up after I complained and try to return the product. They replaced the product and although it took a littl to get it to work, it finally did. Print outs look good and can't beat the price. Printer identifies them as non-HP product, but still works. I still have not Installed the black cartridge. Took time, but they work and can't beat the price"
3922959,B016XTRBIU,5,"I received delivery of the MIROO 4 pack compatible 920 ink cartridges on March 2, 2016. I did not use them until March 28th. I was very happy, pleased to see that the ink levels registered and were visible on my HP OfficeJet 6500 as soon as I placed the MICROO cartridges into the printer. I was able to print  two Birthday Cards without any problems, ex. running ink, mis-coloring, or smudging. I will definitely order from MIROO again for the value and quality. Very Pleased with performance and price."
3922960,B016XTRBIU,5,"Works well.  Costs less than HP.  Printer monitors ink level. Works well, Costs less"
3922961,B016XTRBIU,1,Absolute waste of money! I still have ink on my hands two days later. DO NOT believe anyone that posts these were acceptable. FAKE Product
3922962,B016XTRBIU,5,The ink cartridges worked very well!!! Simple AND the ink level shows on my printer.. Will buy again with no doubts!!! Great products!!! Great product!!! Everything work perfectly..
3922964,B016XTRBIU,5,I had a hard time getting them to work... printer kept saying NOT HP... and wouldn't let me install them.... FINALLY after 20 - 30 tries it finally installed them and they now work GREAT.... would order again! FINALLY after 20 - 30 tries it finally installed them and they now work GREAT..
3922965,B016XTRBIU,5,"This product fit my HP printer perfect and prints great, love this! I received this for free. Great product! Fast shipping!"
3922966,B016XTRBIU,5,"UPDATE!!!  The seller contacted me and offered a replacement cartridge based on my review. The new cartridge works as expected. The colors are accurate. Great value.

Original review:The black works as expected, the color cartridges are awful. No where near accurate. I'll keep since the black works, and we rarely print in color, but beware if you like the colors to be accurate. Great solution"
3922967,B016XTRBIU,5,"Works perfectly on HP Officejet 7000. Prints normally, and the levels show up on the HP computer software. Five Stars"
3922968,B016XTRBIU,5,"Purchased this ink about a week ago.  I was skeptical because I have always used HP ink and when I have tried alternatives they have not worked but figured that I would give it a try.  Very pleased.  Print is vibrant.  Very high quality.  I do receive the error message that I am on using HP ink but that does not have any effect on the quality of print.  Make sure you open up the ink on a paper towel or paper that is disposable. It was filed very full.  When I removed the lid I dabbed the cartridge on the paper and that cleaned it nicely.  Highly recommend.

Followup: Purchased 3/16/16. It is now 4/22/16 and I am still delighted and wondering where this ink has been all my life.  It is vibrant and rich.  Still going strong.  No issues or problems.  I was getting ready to get rid of my 5 year old HP printer because of the cost of ink.  MIROO has added new life to my printer and dropped the cost of my printing significantly. Very pleased. Print is vibrant"
3922969,B016XTRBIU,5,"These seem to working fine, and my God the money they saved! Working Well"

3922973,B016XTRBIU,5,"I was worried about the quality because of the low price- WHAT A GREAT SURPRISE! This ink is just as good, if not better, than the MUCH higher priced name brand I had been buying! I will be buying this product again and recommending it! Pleasant surprise!"
3922984,B016XTRBIU,1,This ink doesn't work a need to print something red and it print it black. It doesn't work.
3922985,B016XTRBIU,4,"I was looking for a cheaper solution to buying the HP cartridges from stores and this seems to be a great alternative.  I used to use the Cartridge World stores but those all closed so I was left wondering.  I stumbled upon them on Amazon, read a few good reviews and decided to try them.  Some complained the printer would tell them they are not HP cartridges but I do not have that issue.  The printer is for home/school things so quality is not that important to me but I truthfully do not see an issue and do not see the quality of print diminished.  I would recommend them as a good alternative and they were shipped as expected. ... cartridges from stores and this seems to be a great alternative. I used to use the Cartridge World ..."
3922986,B016XTRBIU,5,My computer recognizes the cartridges as HP! Will continue to purchase from you! Great product!

3922989,B016XTRBIU,4,cartridges came in an easy to open box and although the printer tells me that I have non standard cartrages they print just fine and the price is certainly right.  i have only had them in for 3 weeks but seem to work just fine. Work fine for me
3922990,B016XTRBIU,5,"1 day after buying the black 920 (not xl) for $22 at the local store, I decided to look on Amazon for better pricing.  Here I got the 920xl in all colors for under $9!  They work great from the get go.  I had tried to refill old but it wasn't working well and I needed the black immediately. Never again!

Thank you! No more overpriced cartridges for me."

3922996,B016XTRBIU,5,"Replaced our HP cartridges with these MIROO ones, even though the printer says non HP ink, just press ok....it prints the same at a fraction of the price...I will be buying these and not spending 4X as much on HP ink... Great product, Great price"
3922997,B016XTRBIU,5,"Cheap and good.  I avoided ink spillage problems by removing only one cover (the large plastic one) before placing it in the printer.  Once in the printer, I removed the small tab.  I also took the precaution of cleaning the heads right away but don't know if that was necessary. Cheap and good"

Fast service great price!!!!!! TY for fast service!!"
3923001,B016XTRBIU,4,"For the price, it was good. The quality was almost as good as the hp ink.  At a fraction of the hp price, this is a good deal. As usual my printer made a fuss before accepting the ink. It does that with all non hp ink. Not perfect but I would repurchase it"
3923003,B016XTRBIU,5,works as expected. Very similar to the original HP ink Five Stars
3923004,B016XTRBIU,4,"Excellent value and print quality is very good.
Had to deal with a slew of 'error messages' from my HP printer initially - it did NOT like me using after-market cartridges.  However, replacing the cartridges one by each and cleaning the print-heads (repeatedly) eventually took care of the error messages.
An exceptional value An Exceptional Value & Great Quality, although..."
3923005,B016XTRBIU,5,I can't stop talking abput how good the inks are. I'm a classroom teacher who uses colored ink regularly for my kindergarteners and it worKS and give the same results just like the HP ink.  I'm extremely pleased. good price excellent quality
3923006,B016XTRBIU,5,"I was a little skeptical to purchase this as I usually purchase ink from the company that makes my printer (and spend 6 times as much on the cartridges!) This ink surpassed my expectations and worked just as well for a fraction of the cost! Don't be hesitant, give it a try!"
3923007,B016XTRBIU,5,Works great at a very reasonable price Good HP Ink alternative

3923010,B016XTRBIU,4,"I ordered these for my HP6500 based on the reviews I read on Amazon. I was out of all colors and the HP cartridges are expensive. The price point for Miroo was great so I thought I'd give them a try.  The reviews mentioned that the cartridges leak when you opened them and they were right. Fortunately, I was prepared for this and it really wasn't too big of an issue. I opened them over the sink and cleaned them up with a paper towel. I would suggest wearing disposable gloves it you don't want ink on your hands. I installed the cartridges and had a problem with the magenta not wanting to click all the way down into place. Because of that my printer repeatedly gave me an error message. I ended up using a piece of tape to press it down and hold it. That worked like a charm and no more error message. My printer made sure to let me know that these weren't HP cartridges and I just pressed ok and it moved on. I ran the head cleaning procedure before I did any real printing. The colors look good although I think the black might be a little lighter than HP. I've had no problem printing so far and I would recommend these. The price point alone made them worth a try for me. I would have given 5 stars but the leaking issue was annoying. Quick shipping too. Works with HP6500"
3923011,B016XTRBIU,5,"Fast shipping, great price! great price!"
3923012,B016XTRBIU,5,"Can't beat the price, works just fine and received the next day! Will definitely purchase again"
3923013,B016XTRBIU,5,This installed in my HP printer just like any other cartridge. The ink works perfectly at a fraction of the cost. I won't buy HP ink again! This installed in my HP printer just like any other cartridge
3923014,B016XTRBIU,5,Works great and way cheaper. Five Stars
3923015,B016XTRBIU,1,All okay first time I ever order ink online I'll probably give it another try They seem to be doing fine now but when I open them every one of ...
3923016,B016XTRBIU,5,save your $; this ink works great. this ink works great.
3923017,B016XTRBIU,5,I easily replaced the black cartridge with no problems and my printer accepted it. Printer worked fine
3923018,B016XTRBIU,5,Exactly as promised. No problems Item arrived exactly as promised. No problems. Printer recognizes item as generic but still allows it to be used.
3923019,B016XTRBIU,4,"First thing, be careful when you open the tabs on these. Ink poured out everywhere so make sure you have something under it. The black and yellow cartridges won't snap in place but the others did perfectly. I am waiting on a replacement. The two I installed worked great. I had to run utility to clean printheads after the install. Keep in mind these will void your printer warranty. Mine already ran out so not a big deal. It's definitely worth the money saved, might have to return if you get defective ones like me, but I will buy again.

Update: Company sent replacements but I still had the same problem with cartridge not clicking in place. Didn't click in place"
3923020,B016XTRBIU,5,Works great Five Stars
3923021,B016XTRBIU,5,Works perfect with printer Five Stars
3923022,B016XTRBIU,5,"I have an HP OfficeJet 6500 and the cost of ink has been killing me. I'm self-employed and avoid printing like the plague due to cost. I've tried off-brand ink with another printer before and it was such a disaster I couldn't even use the printer again. So, to say I was wary of trying this is an understatement. However, with the cost so low, I figured I'd give it a try. As another reviewer mentioned, one of my cartridges was so full of ink it spilled all over, staining my hand and (luckily) my linoleum floor (not carpet). After some scrubbing, everything was cleaned up and I'll be more careful in the future. All the cartridges fit right in without any difficulty and the printing is bright, beautiful and flawless! I'm so happy I bought two more sets and recommended it to others! Who Knew an Off-Brand Could Work SO Well?!"

3923033,B016XTRBIU,5,"It was a little tricky getting the black ink cartridge to fit, but it did work out. There is no difference in the quality of the print-outs between this ink and the very expensive H-P. Do yourself a favor and give this ink a try. Very satisfied with this ink"
3923034,B016XTRBIU,5,"Works great in my HP printer and SO much cheaper than the name brand.  The only negative is that every time you turn the printer on, you get a message telling you that they are not HP cartridges but you can easily bypass it.  I will totally keep buying these.  Great price for a great product! Great bargain!"
3923035,B016XTRBIU,5,Great product. Printer showed not hp cartridges but clicked ok and everything was fine. Running perfect. Have already ordered another set to make sure we have replacements when needed. These are great.

3923039,B016XTRBIU,1,"One of the cartridges was missing the chip, so it didn't work at all. The other that I've tried so far leaked all over my hands and would have leaked all over the printer if I didn't have a paper towel underneath it. Very shoddy product and/or QA process. Beware of leaking ink!"

3923043,B016XTRBIU,5,Product arrived in 2 days. Absolutely no issues. Cartridges fit well and work well. The bonus is is still tracks the ink level. The price is the best part. I will be ordering more of these in the future. Great Value
5423631,B016XTRBIU,5,I finally got to use it and omg it works great just like the hp ink I appreciate that I'm able to buy thus and still get the same results I love it havnt had any problems ink dries quickly no smudging or anything bout to buy more Must have
5423632,B016XTRBIU,5,Great price and great ink quality Easy to use
5423633,B016XTRBIU,1,"Waste of money, the first set of 2 that I bought lasted for approximately 3 months. However, the latest set of three each one lasted about 10 pages before being completely empty! Waste of money!"
5423634,B016XTRBIU,5,I have bought multiple cartridges from MIRRO over the last few years and have always been happy with their product and service.  Excellent product at a great price. Excellent product at a great price
5423635,B016XTRBIU,5,"So far so good. No problems installing. Printer message that cartridges are not genuine HP, pressed ok and printer works fine. Printed a number of pages and no problems. Saved about $60 over genuine HP. Whats not to like? Great value."
5423636,B016XTRBIU,1,Did not work at ALL (even changed the settings on my printer) Had to throw them away & two of the cartridges leeked all over my Office rug and had to spend a couple of hrs shampooing my rugs to get the Ink out. Went to Staples and spent more money getting the Hp ink cartrdges Ink very running. No good.
5423637,B016XTRBIU,2,"After not so much time, printer started throwing an error and said that one of the cartridges was empty (it wasn't!), and being an HP printer, the printer wouldn't print anything if something was wrong with one of the color cartridges, not even a black print.  Waste of money, although I blame HP more.  After this bad experience I recycled the HP printer and purchased a little Canon unit that has been working great, and will still print even if one of the color cartridges is empty. Didn't Last Long"
5423638,B016XTRBIU,1,My printer wouldn't accept these ink cartridges Just don't
5423639,B016XTRBIU,1,This ink arrived fast but also ran out fast. I am a teacher and I like to print things with color for the students. After printing 2 color pages the ink was already fading. This is such a waste of money!!! Looks can be deceiving!
5423640,B016XTRBIU,1,"It'd OK for a few weeks, and then the ink disappears.  I don't know where it goes. possibly evaporation, maybe ink heaven. but it renders the cartridge useless. Ink goes away"
